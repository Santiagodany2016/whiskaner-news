      "summary": "We're a bit late with this review. In 2019 Chivas Brothers introduced the Secret Speyside Collection, a range of 15 single malts between 18 and 30 years of age, from four distilleries: Caperdonich, Longmorn, Glen Keith and Braes of Glenlivet. Longmorn had three expressions: the Longmorn 18 Year Old we're trying today, along with a 23 and 25 year old whisky.Since 2024 these Longmorn whiskies (and the entire cross-distillery idea) have been discontinued. The distillery is now reduced to two expressions: a different 18 year-old at cask strength and a 22 year-old, both in fancy bottles with a classy purple / gold house style. They're pushing things further towards the high end of the market, with well-aged whisky at high prices. At the same time I feel there's hardly any marketing and very little buzz around this brand among whisky enthusiasts. In the current whisky climate they'll simply push themselves off the map.Anyway, the previous release is still available in stores, so a review isn't pointless. Longmorn 18 yo 'Double Cask Matured' (48%, OB +/- 2023, American oak barrels + hogsheads) Nose: really bright and fruity. Peaches, tangerines, bananas and juicy pears. Also a subtle tropical edge, like mango. Then light hints of cinnamon and toffee underneath, with raisins and hints of candied ginger. Mild honey, lemon peels and a hint of green pepper. There's a fresh layer of woody notes as well.Mouth: sweet and bourbon-influenced, which means more fruits. Pears, green plums, as well as unripe mango and pineapple. Then hints of dessicated coconut and vanilla custard. White pepper and honey, as well as subtle hints of mint chocolates. Mid-palate it gets a bit more earthy, with the fresh oak growing stronger. Aniseed in the end. A drop of water tones down the woody edge.Finish: medium long, with some berry sweetness, orange candy, vanilla toffee and spicy wood.A pleasant whisky, with plenty of Speyside fruits thanks to the bourbon casks. These were fairly active, also adding spice and coconut sweetness. Overall quite a modern whisky, but really representative for the distillery style, in my opinion. At well over € 100, value for money is not exceptional though. I still found it at Whiskysite.nl. Major retailers like The Whisky Exchange are selling the new version."

      "summary": "I received a set of samples from the latest bottlings by Milroy's of Soho just as I left on holidays. Now that I'm back, I was looking forward to look into them. It is quite a wide selection, from a young blended Campbeltown whisky to a deeply sherried Macduff and one of our favourites: a Ben Nevis 1996. Ben Nevis 28 yo 1996 (51,8%, Milroy's Vintage Reserve 2025, hogshead #1583) Nose: outstanding. Warm, waxy fruits. Apricots, ripe pineapple, mango and hints of lime. Then some peppermint and linden honey. Gradually more sunflower oil and chalky notes come out, but then again also gummi bear notes to balance it out. Up there with the best casks.Mouth: a bit more minty and spicy than some others, with plenty of spearmint and verbena, along with mild white pepper. After that the fruits move forward: lemons, tangerines, pineapple and a little guava. Also tiny hints of pink grapefruit and maracuya in the end. Mild chalky dryness too.Finish: medium length, mixing tropical fruits with mineral elements and a faint grassy and malty edge.Another really good one and certainly the highlight in this session. I've written tasting notes for around 40 sister casks (1996 vintage alone) and I never get tired of them. Still available from Milroy's of Soho. Aberfeldy 10 yo 2014 (55,5%, Milroy's of Soho 2025, dechar-rechar hogshead #420) Nose: quite bulky, with peanut oil, butter pastry and hints of earthy spice. Barley notes, butterscotch, hints of banana bread and herbal honey sweetness. Then also dried grass and vanilla notes.Mouth: slightly prickly, but now a nice wave of fruits appears, with sweet peach, pears and fresh lime. Even a hint of tinned pineapple. Still a generous malty layer as well, along with caramelized nuts. Then a chalky and herbal edge, aniseed and orange cake.Finish: medium length, with citrusy notes, malt and sweet baking spice.The fresh char amplifies the thick and honeyed spirit character of Aberfeldy. A good blending malt but a tad too heavy on its own. However in this line-up it does provide a different profile. My two cents, as always. Available from Milroy's. Score: 81/100 Glen Ord 11 yo 2012 (56,4%, Milroy's of Soho 2025, bourbon barrel #800243) Nose: instantly fresher and brighter. Juicy pears and green apples, with peach and a greener note of nopal. Icing sugar and lemon sweets. Then mint leaves, drops of grapeseed oil and subtle floral notes.Mouth: really fresh again, with plenty of limes (or lemonade) and apple sweets with unripe pineapple. Light earthy notes appear, with green tea and some sharper grapefruit and fizzy candy in the background. Mild oak spice.Finish: quite long, a tad greener still, with mild herbs along with citrus rinds.Slightly narrow perhaps, but I really dig this bright and perfectly sippable style. Perfect for summertime, in my opinion, and I'm sure it makes aweseome highballs. Available from Milroy's. Score: 88/100 Campbeltown Blended Malt 9 yo 2016 (57,1%, Milroy's of Soho 2025, bourbon barrel #9) Nose: distillate-driven, on bread dough and chalky notes, lemons and muesli. Also some green maltiness and minerals. It misses the depth and intensity of Springbank though, adding more fruitiness and creaminess. Then more grassy notes and baking spice. Almost no funk, more of an introduction to the style.Mouth: it starts with lemon zest, grassy notes and a hint of paraffin, which suggest some Glen Scotia. Then some apple and beer notes, along with a firm saltiness and liquorice. A few Haribo bears too. After a while I'm afraid I'm picking up a soapy note, or some lavender, which is bad news.Finish: medium, still bready and citric.Weird. I must admit I'm not expecting soapy notes from Campbeltown distilleries, but I tried different glasses. It's certainly not FWP territory either, but I'd still give the advice to be cautious. If you're looking for a cheap Springbank alternative, this may not be the perfect choice. Available from Milroy's. Score: 76/100 Macduff 16 yo 2008 (66,7%, Milroy's Vintage Reserve 2025, third fill sherry butt #130900362) Nose: fruit-driven sherry. Plenty of raisins, fresh figs, hints of red plum jam and toffee apples. Mild sandalwood, along with sweet mocha, hazelnuts and whiffs of candied almonds. Some modern oak spice in the background, adding punch. Water brings out tobacco but also caramel notes, making it flatter.Mouth: quite hot, yes. Still nicely sweet and fruity though, with red berries, marzipan, candied walnuts, toasted hazelnuts and sweetened coffee. Then plums and sweet orange candy, followed by herbal notes. Quite peppery. Here water brings out milk chocolate and some oaky notes.Finish: long, with a firm spiciness, fruity sweetness, cocoa and caramelized nuts.One of these modern, very active sherry casks (Signatory's 100 Proof profile). The overall richness and deep fruitiness makes this Macduff very attractive though. Available from Milroy's. Score: 88/100"

The first (annual) release is around 6 years of age, matured in refill bourbon casks and then finished in refill Pinot Noir casks for an extra 2 years or so.So even though the emphasis seems to be on the high strength, the red wine theme is still taken further (but now hidden from the front label). In fact the label is still red, so where is the change really? Personally, if you're replacing a series and planning to move beyond red wine (which I'm not quite sure of), then I would have started off the series with something completely different."

      "summary": "It's time to dive into new releases that are exclusive to DeinWhisky. There's an official (peated) Arran cask and a Secret Islay 1991 from the white label series by Sansibar, but we'll start with Family Silver 2001.This undisclosed blended malt (actually a teaspooned whisky) is matured in a first fill sherry cask and comes from the most famous distillery in Speyside. It is bottled in the Cooper's Choice series from The Vintage Malt Whisky Company. Family Silver 23 yo 2001 (43%, Cooper's Choice for DeinWhisky 2025, blended malt, first fill Oloroso sherry cask #44, 324 btl.) Nose: really nice, with a red fruitiness that you rarely get these days. Plenty of raisins, dried apricots and herbal honey. Then also stewed apples and toffee, as well as a lightly fragrant top note, like aromatic rose pepper. Hints of dark chocolate as well, with old coins in the background.Mouth: still this rather fruity sherry profile, with lots of apples, plums, red berries and blackberries. Nectarines too. Semi-sweet, with well-dosed hints of caramel and toffee. Later it moves to floral honey and mild spicy notes (like cinnamon and sweet ginger), with a light cognac-y edge.Finish: not too long, but clean, with hints of spiced marmalade and raisins.While the modest ABV makes it rather mild on the palate, it's definitely not a blocking point. It is simply a mature and very sippable Speyside whisky with an impeccable sherry influence. Recommended, especially given the fair price: € 120 from DeinWhisky.de. Secret Islay 33 yo 1991 (48,2%, Sansibar 'White Label' for DeinWhisky 2025, bourbon hogshead, 253 btl.) Nose: half of it is the tight Islay character, with iodine and sour brine, minerals, menthol and grassy smoke, as well as damp chalk. The other half is rounder vanilla, some lemon and grape, along with sourdough bread. Then sweet eucalyptus and mild phenols. Really good.Mouth: still some creamy vanilla underneath, with peach and sweet citrus, hints of mocha and black peppercorns. The juicy fruitiness is excellent. Then light herbal smoke and drops of antiseptics. A bit of sea salt and acidity.Finish: very long, with velvety smoke, toasted bread and sweet fruits in the background.We knew what to expect, of course. It combines well-aged Laphroaig elements but it also boasts a vibrant, apparently younger side. We've had more complex examples, but again this is such a drinkable, well chosen cask. Available from DeinWhisky. Score: 90/100 Arran peated 10 yo 2013 (58,6%, OB for DeinWhisky 2024, first fill bourbon barrel #2817, 251 btl.) Nose: a rather thick layer of burnt sugar on crème brûlée alongisde a subtle mentholated hint. Then some coconut shavings and vanilla, with plenty of bananas and shortbread. Barbecue ashes and some vegetal notes as well.Mouth: sweet and fruity up front. More bananas, peaches and hints of grapes. A bit too hot perhaps. Custard and roasted malt. On a second sip I get smoked lemon notes and acidic pineapple, along with oak shavings and a pinch of salt. More vegetal peat towards the end.Finish: good length, clean, with increasing levels of peat smoke, as well as lemons, burnt toast and black pepper.Good to see the innate fruitiness and fresh lemony notes of Arran are still present here. The vegetal peat isn't entirely necessary in my opinion, but overall a nice expression. Available from DeinWhisky. Score: 86/100"

      "summary": "Decadent Drinks is one of those bottlers that keeps a very high pace. From their July outturn we've picked three releases from the mid-range Decadent Drams series. They're single malts or teaspooned malts.We're starting with a Speyside single malt made by a famous and highly litigious family. Hence the name Glenlitigious. Glenlitigious 12 yo 2012 (50%, Decadent Drinks 2025, second fill sherry hogshead) Nose: fruits at the centre. Pears, some marmalade and white nectarines. Then a mild hint of sherry spice and herbal honey. Nicely rounded, also the sweetness is kept in check by a subtle chalky and metallic edge.Mouth: attractive again, offering a nice mix of juicy stone fruits, more honey, plenty of oranges. Peaches for sure. Then it moves towards hazelnuts, white pepper and mild clove. Hints of toffee, cereals and balanced wood. It gets a little leafy towards the end, including a gentle bitterness.Finish: medium length, still some coppery notes, along with stewed fruits and spicy notes.Overall a vibrant whisky with a perfect balance of grains, fruits and sherry. This is a style we'd like to see more often in official releases from like... say, Glenfarclas for example. Available from the source or retailers like Royal Mile Whiskies or The Whisky Exchange. Ben Nevis 12 yo 2012 (53%, Decadent Drinks 2025, refill hogshead + fresh sherry hogshead) Nose: starts quite dirty, with a hint of sour milk, mushrooms, vase water and metallic tools. It needs time to settle down. Then wet chalk and raw wool come forward, as well as pears and sweet citrus. Also hints of flower nectar, green leafy notes and a touch of raisin sweetness.Mouth: quite robust, on lemons and grapefruits, along with oily notes, charred oak and mineral notes. Beer hints with a whiff of crushed aspirin, grassy olive oil and light shoe polish. Then flashes of sweet green fruits, overtaken by salty elements and hints of tobacco leaves.Finish: fairly long, with more raisins, hints of ginger and cold coffee in the very end.Quirky whisky, as expected. The 2012 vintage is a difficult one in my book, sometimes really great but often also a little uncomfortable. This has a bit of both. You can get it from Decadent Drinks or Master of Malt among others. Score: 86/100 Westport 21 yo 2003 (53%, Decadent Drinks 2025, blended malt, sherrywood, 228 btl.) Nose: a slightly high-pitched and sourish style. Oranges (perhaps blood orange), hints of flower petals, white cherries and unripe red plum. Subtle tobacco, a little cinnamon and ginger. Always a bit of oak polish in the background and a little honeysuckle too. Quite seductive.Mouth: a tad spin-doctored perhaps, with a light winey touch. Some vanilla and peach candy, with cranberry and fruit cake. Still some acidity to break the sweetness, as well as this aromatic hint of potpourri. Later also almonds, leather and tobacco, leaving a drying edge.Finish: medium long, with hints of raisins and red fruit tea, as well as a leafy tobacco note.Really good, even though it has this slightly peculiar fruity / winey / fragrant side that feels a little contrived. In a blind tasting I may have guessed some Port influence. Pretty similar to the previous cask in that respect. Now available from Decadent Drinks or partners like The Whisky Exchange. Score: 87/100"

      "summary": "Have you ever wondered if whiskey subscriptions are the real deal, or just another trend? Or is it just a way for someone to run through inventory faster? To answer these questions Greg Cohen, the guy behind Pour More joins the show. We set the stage, pulling back the curtain on the rise of these models during covid and how Greg transformed from a marketer to a crucial player in Pour More's journey. I'm geniuonly curious about the business model so we hit on operations, the power of great storytelling, and how landing features in big-name publications put Pour More on the map. Greg breaks down their dual audience – the hardcore connoisseurs and the gift-givers – and how they navigate the maze of alcohol distribution laws. Plus, we pull apart their tiered pricing, and how to balance killer value with exclusive access. Show Notes: Introduction to Greg Cohen and the inception of Pour More. Influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on whiskey subscriptions. Analysis of customer demographics and acquisition methods. Marketing strategies and redefining the whiskey culture. Creating connections with distillers for a unique experience. Challenges in customer retention and innovative solutions. Speculations on the future of whiskey subscriptions and brand storytelling.

      "summary": "Cadenhead’s 7-Stars is a historic brand of blended Scotch whisky. Originally on the market many decades ago, it was revived by Cadenhead a couple of years ago. The retro bottle with the gold foil oozes a 1970s vibe.There are different versions (even a 30 year old) but we're having the basic NAS bottling. I read online that the blend is 60% grain and 40% malt, which makes this a modest blend compared to the more malt-forward examples. I also read that Benrinnes is part of it."

      "summary": "Not long ago I reviewed five American whiskeys bottled for the Wu Dram Clan. Apart from their single malts they seem to have a sweet spot for bourbons as well. Just now they've released another Tennessee whiskey from the 2003 vintage, a sister cask of the one that happened to be my favourite last time.At the same time they're releasing a new Smögen 2014 - another sister cask of a previous release. Check their website for sales information. Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey 21 yo 2003 (48,3%, Wu Dram Clan 2025, barrel #19, 109 btl.) Nose: quite luxurious, on hazelnut paste, caramel and praline, but also fresh minty notes. Sweet corn, drier walnuts, balanced rich oaky notes and sandalwood. Subtle orange peels, roasted coffee beans and ethereal floral notes in the distance. A bit of an after-dinner dram.Mouth: similar associations of velvet sofas and bathrobes, so to speak. Warming oaky notes, mixed with cinnamon and black peppercorns. Tobacco, hints of eucalyptus and honey. Then caraway seeds, maple syrup, just a little coconut, drops of Cointreau and sweet rye bread. A dash of Havana Club 7 Years too.Finish: fairly long, with nice hints of orange cordial, more rye bread, molasses sweetness and hints of glazed chestnut.Quite an excellent Dickel again. It is warm and seductive, but always retains its elegance. Smögen 10 yo 2014 (59,1%, Wu Dram Clan 2025, first fill Four Roses bourbon barrel #13) Nose: damp wood, some light rye bread, wet asphalt and some dusty cement. Then light smoke and fresh oak shavings, as well as a hint of glue and wet chalk. After a while hints of pear and citrus come out, along with subtle dried herbs, making it more Nordic in my opinion.Mouth: intense. There's a nice oily texture, as well as a sweet herbal theme. Then ashy notes, a pinch of salt, light dough, grapefruit peelings and sweet apple. Juniper berries too. Kilkerran springs to mind. In the background also hints of tapenade and plenty of earthy / leafy notes.Finish: long, now more coastal and more citrusy. Decidely mineral with just a very light sooty hint.A very successful youngster that wouldn't misstand in a Campbeltown line-up. Tight, mineral, herbal and lightly smoky. Plenty of character, much in line with the previous cask. Score: 89/100"

      "summary": "Manzanilla casks and Amarone casks, could you possibly think of wine types that are further apart? Anyway that's what Bunnahabhain used for this Turas Math #1 release, presented in the shadow of Feis Ile 2025. The Manzanilla comes from a parcel of full maturation sherry casks, whereas the Amarone parcel was finished for five years.It is the first release in a new Westering Home Collection. In fact a Palo Cortado finish (#2) and an Armagnac cask finish (#3) were launched at the same time. You can get them in a nice 3x 20 cl set, as well as a tasting kit. Bunnahabhain 15 yo 'Turas Math #1' (55,9%, OB 'Westering Home Collection' 2025, Manzanilla + Amarone casks, 3000 btl.) Nose: a nice coastal kick at first - sea spray, minty prickle, seaweed. Salty leather. More sharpness of nutmeg and salinity. In second row there are hints of blackberries, sour cranberries and prunes with a chocolate coating, but not in a jammy way. It stays fairly thin and sharp. Salted walnuts, apple peelings and bread crust, as well as a faint hint of gunpowder. After airing it does become a little rounder.Mouth: a powerful mix of Bunna's saline character (amplified by the Manzanilla perhaps) with rounder notes. Salted nuts, hints of treacle toffee and lot of wood spice, mainly cinnamon and ginger. More walnuts and nutmeg. Then hint of plums and black cherries, flashes of raspberry eau-de-vie and Seville oranges.Finish: long, now also showing (red) winey notes. Some drying tannins, cocoa and herbal notes.An interesting recipe. The Manzanilla is hard to detect as such, even though it may have strengthened the coastal side. The Amarone part is slightly less to my liking, but then again it isn't overdone and it adds a sweet roundness. Sold out from Bunnahabhain direct, but you can still buy from The Whisky Exchange or Master of Malt for instance."

      "summary": "Do you ever just say to yourself, this whiskey needs more proof? Well, if you're already above 140, how much more do you really need? In this episode, we cover the wild world of hazmat bourbon and whiskey. What once started as a rare novelty has turned into constant churn of 140+ high proof releases with everyone running to grab a bottle. We discuss why bourbon should be considered rare while the inclusion of light whiskey is an education problem but it still works for the high proof chasers out there. We talk about the retail end of things but also wonder if this trend will ever die or if it will be on fire forever. Show Notes: Exploration of the hazmat whisky phenomenon and its surge in the market. Historical significance of hazmat spirits and their evolution. Discussion on consumer tendencies towards higher proof and perceived quality. Insights on the novelty effect versus actual taste experiences. Legal and regulatory considerations in the transportation of hazmat whiskies. Predictions on the sustainability of the hazmat trend and potential future shifts in consumer preferences.

      "summary": "Tenjaku is a Japanese whisky. The first thing I noticed is that the website claims it is expertly distilled and aged in Japan. Nice to hear as lower end of the Japanese whisky production largely relied on imported Scotch whisky, re-packaged as a Japanese product. Despite their claims on the website, the label itself says 'product of Japan' instead of 'made in Japan' which is not a good sign.Their background story and information is also a bit thin. We know that Tenjaku is created in the city of Fuefuki (Yamanashi prefecture). The distillery isn't disclosed, but this city housed the Monde Shuzo distillery, responsible for the horrible Fujikai spirit.Their master distiller is called Kenji Watanabe. He has 30 years of experience, they say, but his name only appears on their own product websites. In fact there are several other brands, all very similar. Mikuni whisky or Sanka whisky for instance, created by the same person. All in all very little indication of authenticity, to be honest, so we're cautious about this product.The baseline expression is the Tenjaku blended whisky (40% ABV), but there's also a Tenjaku Pure Malt at 43%. It is aged in heavily seasoned Kentucky bourbon barrels. There's no age statement but the US website claims it is composed of 5-6 year old malts."

      "summary": "The Master's Anthology is a new part of the core range from The Glendronach. Unveiled in December 2024 these three NAS expressions are putting the spotlight on sherry (seasoned) casks with different nuances. This trio now sits alongside its redesigned age-statement core range. Ode to the Valley uses sherry casks with Ruby Port casks. Ode to the Embers is a peated expression matured in Oloroso and Pedro Ximénez casks. The last one is Ode to the Dark, which relies on Pedro Ximénez casks. After their launch in the UK and Germany, they have recently entered other markets as well. Glendronach 'Ode to the Valley' (46,2%, OB 'The Master's Anthology' 2024, sherry + Port casks) Nose: more Port than sherry, which shows as a mustiness. Rather thin and tart fruity notes, such as red plums, cranberries and raisins, along with orange peels. Underneath it shows an alcoholic note and young wood. Then muesli, a certain sour earthy note and roselle tea.Mouth: still high on alcohol, with hints of raspberry eau-de-vie and plum wine, more roselle and cranberry juice. Some darker blackberry underneath, as well as some cold coffee, cocoa and a slightly bloated vegetal note. Then hints of ginger and plain malty notes too.Finish: quite short, with more sour berries, wood spice and hints of cocoa.A very basic malt that is lacking weight and feels a bit diluted, allowing the sourness and alcohol to shine through. Too superficial and not particularly flattering for a series that wants to pay tribute to sherry casks. Available from The Whisky Exchange or Royal Mile Whiskies for instance. Glendronach 'Ode to the Embers' (48,4%, OB 'The Master's Anthology' 2024, sherry casks) Nose: smoke immediately helps to add depth. Toasted bread and smouldering wood logs, along with cinnamon and hints of smoked meat. Also caramelized nuts, dried goji berries and milk chocolate. In the background there's a light vegetal note and a faint hint of rubber boots.Mouth: goes in different directions, without proper integration. Black pepper, liquorice and milk chocolate again, but also more rubber and flashes of tart rhubarb. The sharpness of smouldering herbs and beech wood smoke too. Overall it feels quite young, with a slightly astringency and still the richness I'd expect.Finish: not long, on liquorice, echoes of zesty bitterness and salted nuts.Better than the first one, in my opinion, but only because the peat smoke helps to add weight and to cover up some of the shortcomings. Such as the lack of time to mature. Available from Master of Malt or Whiskysite.nl among others. Score: 82/100 Glendronach 'Ode to the Dark' (50,8%, OB 'The Master's Anthology' 2024, Pedro Ximénez sherry casks) Nose: ah yes, richness has arrived and it's actually pretty balanced. Dried apricots, figs and raisins, some blood orange as well. This is mixed with chocolate, blackberry jam and a hint of mocha ice cream. Light leathery notes and a whiff of polished oak. Pleasantly rich and aromatic, and here the sourness and spirity edge actually lifts it beyond the obvious sweetness.Mouth: the sweet (and rather bloated) PX side is obvious now, although there's still a minty edge and some polished wood that tried to keep things in check. Then a lot of tobacco, walnuts and black pepper, with a hint of Seville oranges and bitter chocolate. Some vegetal notes too.Finish: medium length, still showing a good balance between liqueur-like fruits and savoury elements. Drying cocoa, dates and wood spice.The best of the three sherry tributes. In a way it is a bit contradictory that PX is getting a medal for being the best sherry, but I guess it makes sense in today's whisky scene. None of these are must-have whiskies in my opinion, but from this series Ode to the Dark is the one to try. Now let's hope they get consistency accross different batches. Available from The Whisky Exchange for instance. Score: 85/100"

      "summary": "Today we're trying two peated whiskies from Claxton's Exploration Series. It supposedly contains some adventurous / lesser known distilleries and regions, although Ardmore isn't exactly an outsider. The STR barrique is not a common choice though. Our second dram is Seventeen Smoky Stills, a blended malt. Ardmore 11 yo 2009 (50%, Claxton's 'Exploration series' for High Spirits 2021, STR barrique finish) Nose: some stewed yellow fruit sweetness, but largely overtaken by charred oak, burnt rosemary and hints of mint. Then a little vanilla, citrus and a slight dustiness, in between pepper, dried grass and freshly sawn oak. Subtle hints of coal ashes and cocoa in the background.Mouth: sweet peat smoke, quite warming but still showing this refreshing minty side. More scorched herbs and black pepper. Hints of almonds and some creamy notes. Then back to honey and sweet lemon, with a muddy note and ashes towards the end.Finish: reasonably long, with dry ashy notes and burnt nuts, as well as a mild sweetness of malt and cocoa.Decent Ardmore, not exceptional in any way, but a good daily dram for wintertime. Balanced smoke and the STR is not too invasive. Still available here and there for around € 80. I got a sample from Whiskysite.nl Seventeen Smoky Stills 6 yo 2017 (50%, Claxton's 'Exploration series' 2024, Oloroso sherry hogsheads) Nose: an immature first impression. Hints of hickory wood smoke, with mezcal and a slightly disturbing sourness. Gherkins, along with salted fish. There's a beach bonfire and hints of cod oil too. Hints of syrupy fruits in the distance, but overall the sherry influence is pretty uncommon.Mouth: still a bit unbalanced. Barbecue smoke with red berries, burnt apples and charred apricots. Still a hint of sourness. A little salted caramel, cold coffee and earthy, laefy peat. I'm getting a hint of these burnt edges of sawn wood again.Finish: medium length, on bonfire smoke, briny notes and herbs.I've read this contains Caol Ila and Inchfad. The latter hasn't convinced me often, and the former isn't strong enough to save it. It doesn't really work for me. Score: 74/100"

      "summary": "Thy distillery organized an online tasting at the end of 2024, with a couple of cask samples and new releases. As often with these events, I couldn't attend the tasting but I decided to go through the samples at my own pace.We start with a certified organic whisky made from Odyssey barley smoked with beechwood. You'll find detailed information on the Thy website. Thy 4 yo 2020 - Beechwood smoked single malt (51%, OB 2024, Oloroso sherry cask #470 + 471, 213 btl.) Nose: the typical warm-yet-fresh beechwood influence. Dark soot but also a refreshing peppermint-aniseed combination. Some vegetal notes, hints of smoked bacon. Then dried fruits appear, like apricots, raisins and figs. Earthy tobacco and nougat too.Mouth: thick, oily and sooty, on roasted nuts and caramelized notes. The warmth of the smoke combines so well with these fresh herbs, thin mints, cough drops and light resinous touches. A basket full of wholegrain bread. Fennel seeds. Then back to dark tea, brown sugar and plenty of warm ashes. Really nice.Finish: long, with more herbs, brown bread with salted butter, fading smoke and a metallic note.These kind of Oloroso casks are typically destined for the Thy Bøg expression. They were right to keep these two apart, I guess, as the result is really excellent. Among the best Thy whiskies I've had so far. Next: a release from pale malt, caramel malt and beechwood smoked malt, aged in PX, Oloroso and bourbon casks. Thy Caramel Malt 3 yo 2019-2021 (57,8%, OB 2024, PX + Oloroso + bourbon cask, 365 btl.) Nose: very grainy, with a lot of malty sweetness and caramelized notes. Have I ever told you I don't really like caramel, in whisky but also in desserts? There, I said it. Also hints of cocoa powder and hints of latte. The fresher herbal note of beechwood is very much in the background here. Next also heavily infused tea and Demerara sugar. Overall a bit bloated.Mouth: all about fudge, dark malty notes and plenty of caramelized notes. Chocolate brownies and molasses, more coffee pudding and black tea. Some herbal touches in the distance.Finish: medium length, with burnt cake, cocoa and coffee.Not a bad dram, you know, but a little more one-dimensional than other Thy releases. Interesting as a statement of this style, but not one I feel attracted to. Still available from the Thy website. Score: 81/100 Then we have a cask sample that may be bottled in the future. Thy Bøg-Bourbon 2019 (58,9%, OB 2024, bourbon cask #1260) Nose: the total opposite - pure freshness. Fresh pine wood with a light resinous edge, as well as some leathery notes and white stone fruits. Only delicate smoke. Then back to lemony notes, some coconut shells and echoes of unripe pineapple.Mouth: quite oily, with spicy notes and beechwood taking over. Black pepper and ginger, along with nutmeg and hints of roasted pinewood. Some burnt sugar, along with coconut water and vanilla.Finish: medium to long, rather tangy, with more oak spice, some resinous notes and hints of vanilla.Perhaps a little too focused on oak spice and smoke, which only flashes of fruits. Overall a bit rough with limited complexity. Score: 84/100 We end this session with a PX sherry limited edition. This matured in Pedro Ximénez hogsheads from the Historic range at Casknolia. These are lightly toasted casks with a slightly higher age and a prolonged wine contact. Thy seems to claim they were seasoned with PX sherry wines but given the cask supplier, the lack of a sherry cask certificate in pictures and the organic PX claim (very rare in Jerez) we have significant doubts: are they sure they haven't used PX from Montilla for seasoning? Thy PX 2020 (58,3%, OB 2024, first fill PX sherry casks #389 + 410 + 412, 636 btl.) Nose: youngish, which means the PX is not extremely loud. Plums and blackberries, sure, but also wet forest floor and old wood. A whiff of matchstick heads as well. Then cocoa powder and a little nutmeg. Rather musty and savoury, wiping out almost all Nordic character.Mouth: a similar story - I'm not too fond of this savoury PX style, which imparts few fruity notes. Instead we get cocoa, roasted malt, nutmeg and other wood spice. Only a light hint of the beechwood smoke. Then some mossy and earthy hints.Finish: medium, on roasted coffee beans, old leather , dates and drying cocoa.I'm not always impressed with Casknolia casks, and here as well it doesn't entirely work for me. A very savoury and chocolatey style, which makes it a little more generic than the other whiskies. Score: 83/100"

Despite being one of the most visually stunning distilleries, their fame was not very big (except for a few legendary old bottlings). However we're quite sure the Elixir team can elevate this brand and make its beautiful spirit shine. There is no question that the Singh brothers and master blender Oliver Chilton have ambitious plans for the distillery,Recently they presented the Blueprint Cask Program, an official pre-release series with three expressions that showcase the building blocks of the future at Tormore. There is a 10 Year Old from bourbon barrels, toasted barrels and Cream sherry casks. I'm glad they selected a few of the more reliable cask types for this series (leaving room for the spirit) and not the wine casks used by many others. Each release focuses on a style of maturation that may form the structure of upcoming bottlings.Let's look at these three releases in anticipation of Tormore's official brand relaunch in 2026. Tormore 10 yo - Bourbon Barrel (48%, OB 'Blueprint' 2025, 1500 btl.) Nose: bright and fresh. Peaches and other stone fruits, as well as lemon candy, sweetened lime juice and floral honey. Then a nice hint of vanilla marshmallows and light coconut, as well as greener fruit that start to appear. Some cooling mint and subtle herbs as well.Mouth: a good texture, with a fairly classic Speyside start, which means more orchard fruits. Pear drops, white nectarines and some greener, leafier notes. Green melons, even a very faint tropical note. Mid-palate it shows a subtle bittersweet woody hint, with citrus zest, a faint toasted edge and hints of (dried) herbs. Light peppery heat and subtle caramelized notes too.Finish: medium, with citrus fruits, herbal honey and light oak spice.Beautiful fruity notes and a classic brightness are the key assets here. The wood is well dosed - I think the lightly bitter spice adds depth to the composition. Not spectacular, but assuming this a realistic proposal for what they can offer on a reasonable scale, we're really happy. Available from The Whisky Exchange. Tormore 10 yo - Toasted Barrel (48%, OB 'Blueprint' 2025, 1500 btl.) Nose: spicier of course. Still some orchard fruits (apple), honey and hints of vanilla custard, but these are matched to white pepper, hints of clove, plenty of herbs and some toasted bread. Later dusty almonds and light mentholated hints too.Mouth: even more mintiness and pepper of the virgin oak. The apple note is quite green now, with hints of citrus behind it. Then it turns towards cinnamon and burnt caramel notes, along with a general warming, charred oakiness and hints of toasted walnuts in the end.Finish: quite long, with more of this warmth of oak spice, hints of tobacco and light cocoa in the background.I'm missing the nice fruitiness here, even though the toasted barrels could certainly add punch to future compositions. Not necessarily the direction I had in mind for Tormore, nor the type of whisky they could excel in, but it's nice to see the full width of the stocks. Available from The Whisky Exchange. Score: 83/100 Tormore 10 yo - Cream Sherry Cask (48%, OB 'Blueprint' 2025, 1500 btl.) Nose: far less thick and... well... creamy than I expected. There's a sour fruitiness (cranberry, grape, green apple and orange) with golden raisins and light fudge. Slightly thin though, with a leathery overtone. Then some leafy hints and a whiff of roasted coffee in the background.Mouth: quite thin again, although it boasts interesting flavours like coffee, dark chocolate, black pepper and hints of (Seville) oranges. More plums and grapes as well, alongside roasted hazelnuts. Then a bit of old ale, faint caramel and some coppery notes. The cask seems to do most of the work, but it's remarkable to see it's rather dark and thin, rather than sweet.Finish: medium, slowly drying, on earthy notes, malted cereals and roasted pecans.This is not the kind of modern sherry style most distilleries are offering these days. My guess would be the use of 'true' solera casks - or maybe just a short finishing period with seasoned casks. It will be interesting to see where they're going with this profile - it could certainly make them stand out from the crowd. Sold out at The Whisky Exchange (and most other places). Score: 87/100"

      "summary": "After some of the whisky releases, we're now looking at the rums that were included in the latest batch of Whisky Jury bottlings. Two of them are high ester rums with the beautiful Ester Hunter label, and the third is a TDL from the 2002 vintage. While this doesn't have the reputation of some other vintages, I do remember a very unique and very funny 2002 from FRC.You could check their retailers list, but a lot of the releases are gone before you know it. Diamond 2014 (53,6%, The Whisky Jury 'The Ester Hunter' 2025, John Dore double retort pot still, cask #5, 280 btl.) Nose: very expressive Pattex glue and cellulosic varnish, with engine oil and hints of olive brine. New leatherette and anise, along with crushed peppermint leaves. Then sour apples and overripe bananas, as well as some lemons. Also subtle rose petals and a musky aroma in the distance. Topped with a whiff of smoke. Spot on.Mouth: quite hot, dry and pure. A lot of industrial varnish, with liquorice, green olives and plenty of salty brine. However there's also a subtle fruity note, think green banana, unripe pineapple or sour berries. Overall it grows slightly darker than the nose suggested, with tonka bean, salted liquorice and light caramelized pecans in the background. Water helps to highlight the fruitiness and bring out some herbal notes and a bit of extra sweetness.Finish: medium long, but quite hot again, wiping out some flavour. Hints of banana, more of that salty liquorice, and leather.This quirky still leads to a very powerful combination of salty and sour notes with high esters. The nose was great, but on the palate you have to work a little (with water) to find the best balance of industrial strength and more accessible flavours. HD 15 yo 2009 DOK (55,9%, The Whisky Jury 'The Ester Hunter' 2025, cask #3, 173 btl.) Nose: a truckload of overripe bananas and pineapples, mixed with gherkins and modelling glue. Balsa wood, black olives, a whiff of acetone and a touch of marzipan. New plastics and candied ginger too. Over time a clear wave of aged cheese gets stronger - not for everyone.Mouth: more fruits than the Diamond, but still equally impressive funky notes. Drying esters (rather mineral at some point), with massive varnished notes and brine. Green apples and green lemons, as well as pineapples and rotting bananas. A sour (woody) roughness in the end.Finish: long and mineral, with lots of salty notes, with echoes of bananas and a hint of new plastics.Definitely an ester bomb again, this high marque HD. Slightly rounder than the 2009 DOK for TastToe perhaps, but with a few wacky additions. Approach with caution. Score: 90/100 TDL 2002 (56,1%, The Whisky Jury 'The Many Faces of Rum' 2025, refill barrel #16, 229 btl.) Nose: immediate fruitiness. Hints of passion fruits, melons, subtle lychee and succulent red Moselle peaches. A nice mint / lime combination too - this always works. Hints of apple tea, whiffs of diesel and soft leather in the background.Mouth: still fruity - the vineyard peach notes are impressive. Hints of mango, golden kiwi and papaya as well. The fruits are overtaken by mentholated notes and spice rather quickly, which means it doesn't quite reach the tropical blast of some of the 2003 or 2009 bottlings. Then hints of vanilla, eucalyptus and herbal syrups, as well as a light hint of petrol.Finish: quite long, still showing this strong combination of fruit and mint. A very subtle medicinal edge too.A lovely TDL again, even though the palate doesn't entirely fulfill the promise set by the glorious nose. Have I ever told you Moselle peaches and mangosteens are my favourite fruits? Despite the slightly less exuberant palate, it offers a lot of classic mentholated TDL markers. It proves that several vintages have great results. Score: 91/100"

      "summary": "We know Malternative Belgium as the leading independent bottler of cognac, of course. However in March 2025 they also ventured into calvados selection.Now calvados is a drink we're not very familiar with. The ones we tried were almost exclusively from Christian Drouin's stock. Some of them were really impressive, although we're also realistic about their potential market share: most people seem to have trouble with its obvious fruit character, far more than in cognac for instance.Malternative Belgium chose to enter the market of Le Calva with three releases at once, all from Christian Drouin indeed. Calvados Christian Drouin 1964 'La Bolide Normand' (44,1%, Malternative Belgium 2024, 60 btl.) Nose: a mix of oxidated apple and bright apple juice. Brown sugar sweetness, hints of apple crumble and generous cinnamon. Hints of Sirop de Liège as well (however, may I suggest Stroopstokerij Wiertz instead?). Then whiffs of old furniture and subtle nail polish, as well as some musty forest aromas, wet soil, som walnuts and hints of black nougat.Mouth: sweet and sour. More stewed apples and crumble, as well as cinnamon pastry. Then it becomes darker, on walnuts and roasted chestnut, along with mild bittersweet elements, orange peels and clove. This merges with black tea, cigar boxes and dried apple cubes. Rather more herbal in the end.Finish: long, still balancing between herbal tea, stewed pears and wood spice. Quite a dry finale.This is Calvados Domfrontais, so there's a bit of pear in the mix. It's really old and really complex, with evolved fruit notes and a firm bittersweet theme. A worthy after dinner dram. Available from Malternative Belgium and their partners. Calvados Christian Drouin 1987 'Noix Surprise' (47,2%, Malternative Belgium 2024, Oloroso cask, 60 btl.) Nose: dried fruits right away. Prunes and dates, as well as raisins, and plenty of savoury notes underneath. Then brighter hints of sour cherries, as well as walnuts, roasted almonds and hazelnuts. Echoes of old leather saddles in the background. And yes, a few apples as well. A nice hybrid of sherry and calvados.Mouth: quite earthy again, with a bit of pepper, chocolate truffles and some tannins. Then back to figs, dates and blackberry, along with many nuts. There's more than a hint of cognac-like rancio as well - this could be mistaken for one of the more robust cognacs. Apples have less to say here, although they lend the composition some round sweetness.Finish: very long, with more herbal notes, walnuts and some juiciness of stewed pear.A nice surprise indeed, especially if you're a sherry lover. It's somewhere on the crossroads of oloroso, calvados and cognac. Why choose? Probably the highlight in this selection. Available from Malternative Belgium and their partners. Score: 90/100 Calvados Christian Drouin 19 yo 'Beurre et Chaleur' (51,8%, Malternative Belgium 2024, 60 btl.) Nose: slightly rougher and younger, with a clear hint of latte, butter toffee and cocoa. Also lots of pastry notes, apple pie with vanilla of course, hints of cinnamon rolls and roasted almond flakes. Liquorice too. There's more of an eau-de-vie character, but also a candied sweetness.Mouth: baked fruits, quickly followed by a bigger bitterness than in the other releases. Toasted flavours, roasted chestnuts and walnuts, with liquorice roots and spicy sweetness. Then drying hints of tobacco leaves and old leather again, with sparkles of fresh yellow apple. Dark cherry in the background.Finish: long, still dark and drying, with liquorice, burnt sugar and a light earthiness.Nice aromas and flavours again, but slightly rougher and less 'malternative' in my opinion. This appears to be sold out, so maybe people were attracted by the accesible price, but I feel it's nowhere near the other two. Better save up for the Oloroso cask. Score: 87/100"

      "summary": "I was quite surprised when I found out the latest batch of The Whisky Agency bottlings contained three Port casks. I double-checked, and then once more, but yes: three Port casks. I don't think there have been many Port examples from this bottler (Port Ellen doesn't count, ha), and now we're getting three at once!I'm not a fan of red wine casks and Port is usually closer to red wine than sherry for instance, often overpowering the spirit. Deanston 17 yo 2008 (52,1%, The Whisky Agency 2025, Ruby Port barrique, 164 btl.)Nose: typical red fruits, like redcurrant and cassis, along with subtle potpourri and peonies. A nice sourness of Kriek beer, with figs. Then also a citrusy top note (lemon peel), with a little rose pepper and a whiff of fresh mint.Mouth: now the winey side is bigger, with more grape skins, cranberries and a lightly bitter edge. Still a high acidity, with sour cherries, goji berries and under-roasted coffee. Green pepper, rosemary, raisins and light tannins. Even a hint of salted nuts.Finish: medium length, with a nice sweet-sour balance, just a hint of cocoa and more red fruits.A nice nose and even the palate is quite good, with a moderate sweetness and a balanced sour side. One of the better Port maturations I've had recently. Still a bit of a 'designer' whisky though, a weird choice coming from TWA. Available in a wide series of shops."

      "summary": "While bottled in December 2024, this Local Barley was launched early 2025 so it's known as the 2025 release. I'm always keen to try the annual Springbank Local Barley but finding a sample isn't easy - perhaps even more difficult than finding a bottle. The last I tried was the Local Barley 2022 release if I'm not mistaken.This year it is a slightly younger version with a very high yield. They used Bere barley (just like in 2017) from the High Ranachan farm close to Campbeltown. Maturation took place in 50% bourbon casks and 50% sherry. Springbank 'Local Barley' 8 yo 2016 (58,1%, OB 2025, bourbon + sherry casks, 13.500 btl.) Nose: maltier than expected, along with melons, hay and wet wool. The initial impression is one of mildness and roundness. Some tobacco leaves, as well as a matchstick note underneath. Nothing disturbing. Then also wet limestone and rags from a car workshop. Subtle vanilla in the background, as well as honey and some fragrant lemony notes, but also increasing herbal hints.Mouth: more typically Springbank now, in my opinion. Really oily, with subtle antiseptics, silver polish and hints of soot. Then a firm peppery kick (adding a green character). Once this fades there are more greasy notes, brine, along with nutmeg and cumin. Darker towards the end, with some black tea and chocolate. Overall the sherry seems less prominent than the bourbon side.Finish: quite long, robust and spicy, even slightly tannic, with an underlying smokiness, malt and gingery notes.The alcohol kick and the light sulphury edge are 'working points' so to speak. For me this 8 Year Old ends up in the lower regions of the Local Barley ranking. The other Bere barley version wasn't a favourite either, by the way. Sold out, I believe, and always irritating price differences."

      "summary": "I'm still picking up strength when it comes to my tasting nerve, which is why you're seeing less of these large sessions and more individual reviews these days. Slowly this will change, although the holidays are coming up and that's usually not a very productive period.Anyway, I though it was time for an armagnac session with six bottlings. This includes the latest from Journal des Kirsch, Liquid Treasures and Grape of the Art, but also a couple of slightly older releases. Bas-Armagnac Garreau 36 yo 1988 (45,9%, Liquid Treasures for Korea Brandy Society 2025) Nose: nice raisins and juicy currants, along with some minty freshness and furniture polish. Hints of cinnamon pastry in the background, as well as light tobacco and peaches. A beautiful rancio side too, bringing this very close to a well-aged cognac.Mouth: now the oak is more prominent, bringing more tobacco to the table, as well as leafy notes, walnuts and some heavily infused herbal tea. Still some dried fruit and hints of currants underneath, as well as a vinous side, camphor and menthol. The piney oak and cedar wood make it a rather rustic armagnac.Finish: quite long, with more herbal tea, walnuts and earthy tobacco.Quite an impressive nose but a tad too vinous and woody on the palate. Domaine de Danis 1986 (46%, OB 2022, cask #31) Nose: fruity and elegant. Lots of stewed pears and peaches, with some mango and whitecurrant, as well as lime. There's a fine oaky side - vanilla, whiffs of cigar boxes, along with some eucalyptus.Mouth: a refined, almost feminine and fruity profile, much like cognac. More apricots and sour currants, raisins and even hints of pink grapefruit. Then a light mineral and salty edge, and polished oak that is well dosed. In the end some tobacco and herbal notes come out.Finish: on the shorter side, but fresh, with light rancio, mint leaves and citrus.Much closer to cognac this time. Very refined, with a bright and lightly tropical fruitiness that makes me forget about the lower ABV. Highly enjoyable. Score: 89/100 Armagnac Darroze - Domaine de Busquet 1999 (49,5%, Journal des Kirsch 2015 btl.) Nose: quite the opposite now, very rich and full-bodied. Plenty of dark prunes and black cherries, cigar boxes, furniture polish and deep earthy notes underneath. Then also dark chocolate, walnuts and tobacco leaves, along with whiffs of herbal tea. Old leather too. Very forthcoming.Mouth: very intense again. Lots of cedar wood with dark fruits. Plums, cherries and raisins. Then back to leather and hints of black pepper. Tobacco is really a big component here, along with a subtle mentholated note, liquorice, cinnamon and subtle clove. Bitter orange peels underneath, but never becoming too rustic in my opinion.Finish: long, with a more resinouswoody notes but only a mildly bitter herbal note.The other side of the spectrum. This is a very rich and intense armagnac, in a more robust tradition but showing an impressive width of flavours. Very typical, and rather well priced too. Score: 90/100 Bas-Armagnac Garreau 32 yo 1992 (52,6%, Liquid Treasures 'Collection du Chai Doré' for Bar Arrangé Korea 2025) Nose: very elegant hints of polished floors and furniture, with floral overtones of hyacint. Then some peaches and caramelized white chocolate in the background, along with fresh mint leaves and light volatile notes. Later it also develops a mossy / leafy background note.Mouth: a slightly punchy attach, with plenty of rich woody notes, as well as eucalyptus oil and mint. Then tobacco leaves, a little leather, some walnuts and a drop of really old Oloroso. Underneath there are still plummy notes and a brighter citrus note.Finish: long, citrusy and nutty, with some dark pastry notes.Really good armagnac, well refined by long ageing. The woody side is less than the 1988 but still borderline - luckily there are also more fruity notes in this case. A classic profile. Still a few bottles available from eSpirits. Score: 88/100 Bas-Armagnac Marquesteau 25 yo 1998 (51,7%, Grape of the Art 2024, cask #225, 310 btl.) Nose: a really nice mix of candle wax and polished floors. Wet wood. Nice mint and berry aromas, as well as blood oranges, prunes and juicy apricots underneath the uniquitous woody side. Hints of vanilla too. Really aromatic and rather on the heady / varnished side of the spectrum.Mouth: more exotic woods come out, along with cigar leaves, chocolate mints, a hint of salted caramel and the acidity of artisan coffee. Also walnuts, sour cherries and marmalade. Then the tobacco keeps increasing, along with herbal drops, some drying tannins and hints of leather.Finish: quite long, with dark toasted wood, mint, vanilla and wood spice.Quite an intense armagnac, with deep flavours and a firm woodiness that is slightly drying but overall quite pleasant. A very classy / classic example, but good value for money. Available from several GotA partners. Score: 86/100 Armagnac Jean Cavé 1979 (54,8%, Swell de Spirits 2024, 200 btl.) Nose: quite some furniture polish, light glue and cigar boxes. Some cherries in the background, as well as light acidic chocolate. Then earthy rancio, a bit of forest floor, sweet cinnamon and clove. Whiffs of eucalyptus as well.Mouth: really punchy, with more exotic woods, plenty of tobacco notes and light hints of varnish. Hints of aniseed and more of this acidic dark cocoa. Old herbs, a little earthiness again and resinous notes.Finish: quite long, quite concentrated, on eucalyptus, old oak and rancio.Not that far from the Marquesteau: slightly robust and rustic. This one has a less intrusive oakiness, yet it also shows a slightly flatter profile despite the higher ABV. Score: 86/100"

      "summary": "Most bottlers have pushed a last batch of releases before the summer break. The Whisky Jury had a number of whiskies, rums (stay tuned) and their first Calvados (later). We start with two highlights among the whiskies: Ben Nevis 1998 and Kildalton 2003. The latter is technically a blended malt, but of course the name refers to a single distillery in particular.You could check their retailers list, but a lot of the releases are gone before you know it. Ben Nevis 26 yo 1998 (48,3%, The Whisky Jury for Belgium 2025, refill hogshead#1562, 92 btl.) Nose: very attractive, with a hint of marshmallow and marzipan, along with peach, tangerine skin and mild vanilla. Ripe mango as well. Then hints of paraffin and beeswax, as well as a light minty note and some brass polish. Whiffs of gorse, hay and honey as well.Mouth: still rather superb. Sweet and slightly tropical fruits, like tangerine, apricot and guava, as well as oranges and gooseberries. Still a hint of marzipan. Then it becomes rather more mundane, with plain barley and some beer-like notes, some dried grass and a subtle hint of salted butter. Boiled sweets, ginger and more maltiness.Finish: reasonably long, on citrus and pear, yeasty notes and mild oaky notes.I know the 1996 vintage is usually seen as the pinnacle of recent Ben Nevis, but this 1998 is very, very fine as well. A slightly different and sweeter fruitiness, but really great. It will be hard to get, even if you live in the right country, but quite a must for your Nevis collection! Kildalton 21 yo 2003 - Blended Malt (51,3%, The Whisky Jury 2025, second fill bourbon cask #11124, 276 btl.) Nose: very coastal, with lots of elegant peat and graphite. Smouldering leaves and coal smoke, hints of menthol and mild antiseptics, as well as some beach pebbles. Such a great sooty style! Also crushed chalk and smoke lemon juice. Underneath there's a sweeter vanilla layer and something of stewed kiwi. Excellent.Mouth: big, brave and oily, with more of this gloriously maritime profile. Crushed sea shells, hints of smoked fish, fisherman's ropes and a good dose of freshly laid tarmac. Some TCP. Then subtle hints of sweetened lemon juice, with greener peppery notes and honey glazed meat.Finish: long and warming, with more tarry notes, seaweed and deep smoke, along with a hint of sea salt and tobacco.If you were only thinking of buying the Ben Nevis, think twice. This is a really excellent 'Beg with a gutsy profile: the tarry smoke is matched to just enough sweetness. Love this. Score: 91/100"

      "summary": "It takes us a while on the Bourbon Pursuit side to find a craft brand that has great whiskey and a great story. And when we get to bring someone on from the Centennial State, it's even better. We sit down with Al Laws, the guy behind Laws Whiskey House in Colorado. Laws is known for their four-grain bourbon, but Al's journey wasn't always in whiskey and he took some pivots from the world of finance and oil to get there. We dive deep into Al's whiskey-making philosophy and he shares some great stories about sourcing grains right there in Colorado and how they approach their flavor profiles. Of course, we're also going to talk about the business side of things, including the financial hurdles distilleries face, especially in the wake of the pandemic. Colorado was also on the forefront on the rise of cannibis and we talk about how Laws Whiskey House navigated through that boom in his area. Show Notes: Al Laws' transition from finance to whiskey The significance of Colorado's whiskey culture Crafting a unique four-grain bourbon at Laws Whiskey House Insights on flavor profiles and local grain sourcing Navigating the challenges of distillery business in evolving times The impact of new market competitors on whiskey sales Building community support and brand identity over 14 years Aging whiskey in Colorado's distinctive climate Support this podcast on Patreon Learn more about your ad choices.

      "summary": "Glenfarclas tends to bottle an Easter Edition for the German market. This year they released the Easter Edition 2014 vintage, fully matured in sherry casks. Judging by the (natural) colour and the preferences of the distillery, probably second fill or even third fill sherry casks. Glenfarclas 2014 'Easter Edition' (46%, OB 2025, 3000 btl.) Nose: their typical balanced (refill) sherry influence. Minty freshness with some coppery hints. Really citrusy, on orange peels, lemons and subtle hints of green apple. Then also a dustier note, with hay, bread dough and a some old wood. A light nuttiness comes out after a while.Mouth: quite sweet, with more citrusy notes. Oranges, pears, light vanilla cream and hints of raisins. A bit of honey. Mid-palate the sherry spice comes out: ginger and nutmeg. Then dark chocolate appears, along with more roasted nuts and light hints of tobacco.Finish: medium, with warming spice and a light caramelly sweetness, along with a slightly drying leathery note.This Glenfarclas is rather on the light side of the spectrum, so indeed appropriate for the Easter season. A kind of sherry that is becoming less common. Rather nice but a bit pricey for what it has to offer. Around € 65-70 from German stores, or also from The Netherlands through Whiskysite.nl for instance."

      "summary": "Kilchoman celebrates its 20th anniversary with a parcel of 20 casks selected by Anthony Wills. They are combined into 4 vattings of five casks each, between 14 and 18 years old: two bourbon bottlings and two sherry bottlings.I picked the two oldest releases: the 15 Year Old from ex-sherry casks and the 18 Year Old from ex-bourbon barrels. Kilchoman 18 yo 2006 (46%, OB '20th Anniversary Series' 2025, bourbon casks #33, 146, 149, 155, 163, 3153 btl.) Nose: complex and balanced. A lot of mentholated notes at first, with warming wood smoke and some dried grasses. Then rounder hints of vanilla and butterscotch, along with hints of peaches and citrus. A nice cask influence after all these years.Mouth: still fresh, with a lot of peat smoke, citrus and mint leaves. Lemon notes, just a hint of caramel and smoked bacon. Then white pepper, hints of carbon and plaster, along with a few briney drops. Still a bit of peach sweetness in the background. There are flashes of Port Ellen, perhaps more than in other distilleries on Islay, although the modest ABV lowers the fun a little.Finish: medium, with more coastal notes, slightyly acrid smoke and bit of caramel sweetness to round it off.A really good Kilchoman, the oldest ever bottled, or at least the oldest that I know of. Nice all-round qualities, with the modest ABV as the only showstopper. Very few bottles left in stores. Kilchoman 15 yo 2008 + 2009 (52,7%, OB '20th Anniversary Series' 2025, sherry casks #644, 670 + 16, 444, 513, 1209 btl.) Nose: quite dark and caramelly, can we assume PX has a big share in this parcel? Molasses, figs and latte with vanilla syrup. Also caramelized nuts and mocha candy. Hints of mead. Then warming smoke and some black peppercorns. Hints of salt and citrus in the distance, countering the caramelly side.Mouth: a good kick, with a lot of peppery smoke, tobacco leaves, a bit of salt and a hint of roasted pineapple and blood orange. This mingles with a lot of black cherries, cassis jam and figs. Hints of chocolate mints, moving towards cocoa and leafy notes in the end.Finish: long, with iodine, sooty notes and hints of dark chocolate, as well as drying tobacco leaves.Quite multi-faceted again - a nice composition of sweeter and drier sherry casks. I may need to try more Kilchoman, although you can't deny these bottles aren't exactly cheap. Also hard to find. I bought a sample from Whiskysite.nl. Score: 89/100"

We'll come back to the Fragrant Drops series soon, but today we're looking at Elevenses with a young Speyburn and a Secret Wigtownshire (probably Bladnoch). Speyburn 10 yo 2014 'Super-Duper Lemony' (50%, Elevenses 2025, refill bourbon hogshead, 361 btl.) Nose: eau-de-vie of lemons and barley. Some new make notes of pear drops. Also granny smith, light chalky notes and plenty of lemon sherbet and lemon peels. Later also dried grasses. Simple, for springtime.Mouth: still very young. Now it does have pretty spectacular hints of lemon sweets or lemon ice cream. As if they added some synthetic flavouring. Then unripe gooseberries, a hint of vanilla and plenty of green apples. A little dextrose and hay as well.Finish: rather short, greener, with a raw edge.Very low complexity, but I have to admit the lemon sweet flavour is quite remarkable. Clearly young though. Available from Master of Malt with a discount. Secret Wigtownshire 6 yo 2018 'Lemon Sherbet, Anyone?' (50%, Elevenses 2025, first fill bourbon barrels, 565 btl.) Nose: slightly more full-bodied, with more hay and also more oak. Some vanilla pastry, banana and red apples. A light astringency too, like burnt sugar.Mouth: quite light, with more red apple sweetness, along with lemon peels, green banana and grapefruit juice. The bourbon oak is noticeable as a lightly toasted edge. Some toast and biscuits too. Pepper and ginger comes out later.Finish: not exactly mature, so a short finish with limited flavours.Again quite fresh and summery but also a bit boring to be honest. If easy-drinking is what you're after, then the Speyburn is rather more enjoyable. Also seen at Master of Malt. Score: 79/100"

      "summary": "On this dynamic episode of Bourbon Pursuit, we're pulling up a few extra chairs to the table for a killer panel discussion! Your host Kenny Coleman is wrangling some serious bourbon brains: Fred Minnick, Blake Seelbach, Eric from Breaking Bourbon, and Brian Sipp from Sip and Corn. We kick things off with a little banter about those inevitable tech glitches and distillation woes before diving deep into the real meat and potatoes: what does it really take to launch a bourbon brand today versus five years ago? Blake points out that while getting started might seem easier with more resources available, the true test of survival for any new brand hinges on smart distribution strategies in an ever-consolidating market. The crew digs into critical topics like consumer education, the art of storytelling, and how to even compete against the established giants out there. Fred brings his signature insight, emphasizing that today's consumers have evolving expectations – new brands have to deliver on both quality and effective marketing. The panel also explores how whiskey marketing itself is changing, agreeing that a compelling narrative is absolutely essential to stand out in this saturated market. We chew on the pros and cons of the direct-to-consumer model and even debate whether contract distillation is the smartest play for newcomers. As we wind down, Kenny leaves us with an encouraging thought: building a brand is tough, no doubt, but with the right approach, it can be incredibly rewarding. This episode is packed with insightful discussion, plenty of laughs, and is a must-listen for anyone who loves bourbon or dreams of launching their own brand. Show Notes: Who are the panelists that joined Kenny? Tips for improving tech setups for podcasts. Current challenges and opportunities in starting a bourbon brand. The importance of consumer education in the bourbon space. How to navigate distributor and retailer dynamics. The significance of storytelling for new whiskey brands. The benefits and pitfalls of a strong online presence. Insights on contract distillation as a pathway for newcomers. Future trends and predictions for the bourbon industry.

      "summary": "The guys at Whisky Picnic Bar in Tainan, Taiwan are loyal readers of this blog, and loyal providers of samples despite the obvious distance. They don't seem to have a website, so I'll happily link to their Insta profile. Cheers.I got to try three of their recent bottlings, all from Islay. The first two are single malts from unnamed distilleries (which are quite obvious nonetheless) and the last comes from Bruichladdich (with the help of The Whisky Agency). Islay Single Malt 33 yo 1990 (52,3%, Whisky Picnic Bar 2024, bourbon barrel #4404322, 110 btl.) Nose: grapefruits and limes with a little olive oil and shy hints of mango. Then some bandages and new wool, menthol and a bit of faded smoke in the background. Then light honey, drops of sesame oil, brine and tiny herbal notes. Just a whiff of vanilla cookies as well.Mouth: more assertive, with clear briney notes, vegetal oils and pepper. More smoke, along with subtle greasy wax. Then a hint of sweet mustard, mixed with pomelos, greenish pineapples and lemon peels, aniseed and dried herbs. Salty citrus.Finish: quite long, with mineral smoke, sea salt, herbs, lime and echoes of passion fruits.A very focused and chisseled example of these 1990 Islays. Some of them have more overt (tropical) fruits but this has a lot to like as well, such as a fresh peatiness that's still standing strong. Very good. Secret Islay Single Malt 9 yo 2013 (53,9%, Whisky Picnic Bar + Cuckoo 2023, hogshead #13000581, 120 btl.) Nose: warm peat smoke with plenty of maritime notes and mentholated notes. Smoked sea salt, ashes, smoked ham and lemon juice. Then some drier leafy notes and peanuts, as well as a bright hint of mirabelle and a hint of vanilla. Fairly simple (a bit like the official 8 Years) but entirely classic.Mouth: very deep Islay notes, now coming across a bit older than it actually is. Coal ashes, more lemons, with black peppercorns and tart orange, as well as some honey sweetness. Kippers and brine. The mid-palate herbal notes grow stronger, with liquorice and a subtle bitterness. It gets sharper towards the end, with hints of clove.Finish: very long, darker and drier. Plenty of sooty notes, a little olive brine, herbs and charcoal.Sharp and incisive at times, but the typical smoky warmth of this distillery brings it all together. A great youngster and a nice selection. Score: 89/100 Bruichladdich 11 yo 2010 (52,7%, The Whisky Agency for Whisky Picnic Bar 2022, Rivesaltes barrique #2136, 90 btl.) Nose: dark cassis, juicy figs and raisins, as well as raspberry jam and hints of sweet grapes. A light mustiness underneath (wet wood, old leather), along with some meaty hints, honey, roasted coffee beans and mild chocolate notes. Subtle acidity as well, keeping it vibrant.Mouth: quite herbal now, with a subtle bitterness fighting the sweetness. Quite vinous now. Black peppercorns, liquorice, walnuts and more herbal tea. Brown sugar sweetness. Drops of coffee and dark chocolate. Flashes of red berries as well, but the dry and savoury side tends to take the upper hand.Finish: long, dry and dark, with more coffee and black pepper.We've had sister casks from the same bottler twice. This one is more or less in the same ballpark, but the savoury side, the sweetness and the vinous elements struggle to decide who is on top. Score: 86/100"

      "summary": "In June 2025 Springbank distillery kicked off a new annual Springbank Vintage series. This collection will feature limited editions that showcase some of their oldest whiskies.The inaugural release is the Springbank 1998 Vintage, which matured in sherry casks, a mix of refill and first fill Oloroso casks. As a vintage release it doesn't have an age statement, but it is meant to be a replacement for the Springbank 25 Years.Kudos to Springbank for also offering a tasting pack which included samples of this new release, along with the latest Local Barley and new batches of some ongoing releases. There's an accompanying online tasting in July but we couldn't wait until then. Springbank 1998 Vintage (48,3%, OB 2025, Oloroso sherry casks, 1500 btl.) Nose: a lot of funky notes, wet wood and mulching forest leaves, really savoury. Salty air, old resin and a musty cellar. In a second wave I'm getting dark cocoa, hazelnuts, fudge and hints of dates. Later I'm also picking up flashes of a fruity sourness, think cranberries and sour cherry, as well as a mild hint of faded potpourri.Mouth: on the thin side, and very savoury with lots of herbs and tobacco leaves. Plenty of wet soil. Then sea salt, more roasted nuts and lemon peelings. Black peppercorns and hints of linseed oil. Roasted chestnuts and coffee. Only flashes of sour berries. Mid-palate a meaty / winey note comes out, closer to a red wine cask than to Oloroso in my opinion. Herbal extracts and some leather as well.Finish: medium length, with more leather, some salted caramel and nutmeg.This is a really good whisky, brought down by one characteristic that bothers me. It's hard to put the finger on it, but it leans too much towards musty and savoury notes for me. Overall still very good but my hopes were even higher. After all independent bottlers have released better casks (granted, at an even higher price). This already showed up at Royal Mile Whiskies and Abbey Whisky but it sells out quickly. I suppose it will also appear in other countries shortly."

      "summary": "Abasolo claims to be the first and the only Mexican distillery that makes maize-based whisky. It is also one of the highest distilleries in the world, located at over 2500 metres above sea level in the heart of Jilotepec. A beautiful building as well.This whisky is made with Cacahuazintle corn, which is cultivated over generations for its distinctive flavour. I've read it predates industrial farming by at least 1000 years. The corn is then prepared using a nixtamalization technique, which involves cooking in a lime water, alkaline solution, and roasting in an adapted coffee roaster. A small fraction of the corn is malted. They have a nice description of the process on their website.They use new toasted and used oak for maturation, which takes about 2 years if I'm not mistaken. The first bottling dates back to 2020. Abasolo - El whisky de México (43%, OB +/- 2024) Nose: hints of cheap alcohol at first. Perhaps closer to rum, with hints of green bananas, later also a hint of fermenting pineapple. Vanilla and wood shavings, with a sourness of nail polish in the distance. Then there's a hint of tequila and new leather as well. Later also a combination of citrus and metallic notes.Mouth: quite basic, with very little flavour. I'm getting a banana sweetness again, with a little honey. After that it turns to mineral notes but also raw alcohol, as well as some black tea and gin-like botanicals. A pinch of white pepper comes out as well. Then some shoe polish, along with new wood flavours.Finish: short, including pine needles, some cocoa darkness and more (gentle) tequila notes.An unusual spirit. I'm not a tequila drinker myself but I can imagine this works for people who like tequila or wodka on ice. You could make a cocktail with it. As a sipping whisky, it falls short of most other products from most other countries though. If you're interested, The Whisky Exchange has it."

      "summary": "At the end of 2024 London distillery Bimber launched two limited edition eight-year-old single malts. They are the first age-statement whiskies in its portfolio.The first expression, called Bimber Harmony of Eight, is a combination of ex-bourbon and Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. The other one is a single bourbon cask, selected by the 2024 Bimber Klub tasting panel. Single farm barley, floor malting, slow fermentation, direct fire distillation and no colouring: this distillery is doing things well. Bimber 'Harmony of Eight' 2016 (50%, OB 2024, bourbon + PX sherry casks, 1090 btl.) Nose: just a slight whiff of nail varnish at first, quickly followed by yellow stone fruits and vanilla sweetness. Peaches and yellow plums. Lemon candy and lemon peelings, maybe some unripe pineapple. Then also hints of redcurrants and honey. A resinous hint of birch wood with freshly cut grasses underneath. Quite bourbon-forward so far.Mouth: nice texture, with the bourbon wood creating a sweet and spicy profile. Mint and ginger, with lots of lemon and grapefruit peelings. Some honey sweetness, burnt sugar and yellow fruits make it rounder, helped by a tiny bit of chocolate and vanilla custard that come out later. Then back to white pepper, hazelnuts and hints of oak shavings.Finish: fairly long, with more oak spice, a hint of gingerbread and zesty notes.Highly drinkable whisky at a slightly higher age, with a big bourbonny sway and only echoes of sherry. Quite vibrant but still showing a very youngish side. Available from retailers like The Whisky Exchange or Tyndrum Whisky. Bimber 8 yo 2016 (56,8%, OB 2024, single bourbon cask #11, 268 btl.) Nose: a lot warmer, with heaps of vanilla and sunflower oil up front. Hints of peppercorns, crushed mint leaves, gooseberries and lemon candy. Mild hints of stone fruits and corn flakes. Then popcorn and nougat with peanuts. Simply a lot more presence than the Harmony of Eight. A subtle hint of rye bread and pine needles as well.Mouth: oily but highly wood-influenced, in the best way possible. Bags of oranges and lemons (or rather yuzu), with spearmint, more nougat and hints of green pears. A bit of varnish, ginger and radish or turmeric from the wood. Light charred notes too. Nice freshness, but some grippy spice underneath.Finish: long, on ginger and cinnamon, lemon peelings and highly enduring newish woody notes.Good complexity and a very clean profile, but a little too wood-driven to score higher. The quality is high but I believe I've had even nicer (fruitier) Bimber before. I'm looking forward to slightly less active casks. This bottling was exclusively available to distillery members (at a fairly high price). Score: 86/100"

      "summary": "You know, there are some people in the bourbon world who aren't just part of the industry, they are the industry. And our guest today absolutely fits that bill. We are incredibly excited to welcome the one and only Bernie Lubbers to the show, the newly appointed Ambassador Emeritus at Heaven Hill! Bernie started his journey with Heaven Hill back in 2005, and since then, he's basically rewritten the book on making bourbon fun and accessible through his incredible storytelling and humor. In this episode, Bernie takes us through his fascinating career, including his pivotal role in bringing bottled-in-bond back into the spotlight, how tasting events have evolved, and the impact of age statements on bourbon production. Get ready for some fantastic anecdotes as Bernie shares his passion for whiskey, why quality always comes first, and his take on current market trends, like the growing demand for older, stronger bourbons. Of course, we couldn't have Bernie without a tasting, so we're pouring Bernheim Barrel Proof and William Heaven Hill – a true celebration of unique whiskeys among friends. As he reflects on his new Ambassador Emeritus role and what \"retirement\" actually means for Bernie Lubbers, he gives us some amazing insights into the relationships and creativity that truly fuel the bourbon community. Plus, stick around for some exciting teasers of upcoming releases and Bernie's signature blend of whiskey education with a dash of bluegrass! Show Notes: His transition to Ambassador Emeritus at Heaven Hill and the journey that led him there. The revitalization of bottled-in-bond whiskey in modern bourbon culture. Navigating the complexities of age statements and consumer demand in the bourbon industry. The significance of storytelling and tasting events in enhancing whiskey appreciation. The evolution of consumer tastes towards barrel-proof whiskeys. Upcoming releases from Heaven Hill and the harmonious blend of bluegrass with whiskey storytelling.

      "summary": "In November 2024 Compass Box presented Secrets of Smoke, a kind of upgrade to The Peat Monster. To create this blended malt whiskymaker James Saxon brought together whisky from Laphroaig, Caol Ila, Bowmore, and Ardmore, as well as two of their existing Islay blended malt parcels.A lot of different cask types are working together here: Palo Cortado, Spanish red wine, Marsala, rec-harred American oak and others. Here's the entire recipe: Ardmore from first-fill sherry hogsheads Caol Ila from first-fill Palo Cortado sherry seasoned butts The Peat Monster blend from second-fill Spanish red wine casks Laphroaig from first-fill Marsala barrique Bowmore from refill bourbon barrel A Blended Malt parcel from recharred hogsheads Compass Box Secrets of Smoke (52%, OB 2024, 9792 btl.) Nose: it's quite a deep smokiness, warmer than just Ardmore or Caol Ila. Beach bonfire embers, tobacco leaves, hazelnuts and some chocolate, darkened further by a mild sherry influence. It seems quite old, although it may not have a high average age. Some heather honey, roasted almond, dried fig and a hint of seaweed. After a while it settles down and I even pick up flashes of Bowmore's grilled fruits. Very good so far.Mouth: herbal and savoury peat smoke, with dark and tarry Laphroaig notes as well as smoked almond, wet soil and iodine. Rather tangy and quite medicinal, with plenty of salty notes, white pepper, flashes of tart citrus, carbolic notes and scorched fragrant herbs. A little cappucino and chocolate towards the end.Finish: quite long, on earthy peat smoke, seaweed, dark chocolate, salty notes and light hints of blueberries.Quite a dark and savoury blend, in which it's still possible to pick up individual distilleries. I've tried a few of their latest releases and this one is my favourite so far. It's hard to fault, except for the fairly high price perhaps - € 140 and more. Available from The Whisky Exchange or Whiskysite.nl for instance."

There are also two releases that have an Underwater theme.Today we're looking at some of the older whiskies, from Auchentoshan, Glen Grant and Glenkinchie distilleries. Especially this last one is a name you rarely see from independent bottlers. Auchentoshan 25 yo 1999 (52,1%, The Whisky Agency 2024, barrel, 149 btl.)Nose: abundant green fruits and citrus zests. Lemon and lime peelings, citrus air freshener and fresh linens. Then cider apples, subtle hints of wildflowers and lots of crushed mint leaves, maybe even a little eucalyptus oil. Nicely aromatic.Mouth: clean and zesty again. Plenty of lemon peels, with grapefruit juice, along with hints of grass and white pepper. A bright sourness with a greener, lightly bitter edge. Then hints of green malt, light resinous touches and crystallized citrus fruits. The saltiness is quite remarkable and strengthens the chisseled profile. Just a light hint of (berry) candy towards the end.Finish: quite long, still very citric and saline. On the greener side of the fruit spectrum.A very nice Auchentoshan. It does have the typical Lowlands citrus, including the thin texture and the fairly low complexity. Not my favourite style, but all good."

Noble Rebel - Orchard Outburst (46%, OB 2024, blended malt, ex-bourbon casks) Nose: light and friendly. Plenty of crisp apples and pears, along with some lime and foam bananas. Then some grassy and blossomy touches, along with spring honey. There's some white pepper tingle and a hint of custard powder as well. Slightly sharp but attractive.Mouth: quite punchy again, with lots of green fruits now. Lime, grapefruit, green apple. Light vanilla, later some peach as well. Then zesty / waxy notes come out, along with a saline touch. Grassy notes with hints of cinnamon, more white pepper and subtle wildflowers. The green character makes it a tad sharp and narrow towards the end.Finish: medium, with pepper, green grape and a hint of ginger.This is a very bright and accessible blended malt. It has plenty of fruity notes at its core, but I guess the Glen Scotia adds a few (slightly) rebellious elements too. Overall a nice summer pour at a friendly price. Available from The Whisky Exchange or Master of Malt and plenty of other retailers."

      "summary": "Here are the latest two releases in the Whiskyland series from Decadent Drinks. Both are similar to previous bottlings: Glen Grant 30 Year Old (a combination of a refill 1994 barrel with a refill 1995 barrel) and Springbank 30 Year Old. Been there, done that... boring...? (not) Glen Grant 30 yo 1994 + 1995 (46,6%, Decadent Drinks 'Whiskyland' 2025, two refill barrels, 360 btl.) Nose: plenty of waxy notes - great. Lemon tea with a dollop of honey, along with unripe nectarine, tangerines, green plums and hints of mango. Then light mineral hints and subtle dried herbs, as well as light vanilla. A bit of dusty apple and nice hints of jasmine tea and fresh linen. Very subtle butter biscuits underneath. Very elegant.Mouth: nice pineapple and candied lemon, with more nectarines and greengages. More biscuits as well. Hints of sweet, green grapes and melon. Sansho leaves and spring honey, with minty undertones. Then plenty of waxy hints too, with candied ginger and chalky touches. The mineral side is slightly bigger than in previous releases - love that.Finish: rather long, balancing citrus notes, minerals, gentle herbs and a salty edge.A lovely release, due to the refreshing waxiness alongside bright citrus and plenty of vibrance after all these years. I've said it before, but Angus is a multi-vintage hero. Available from Decadent Drinks or retailers like The Whisky Exchange. Springbank 30 yo 1994 (44,8%, Decadent Drinks 'Whiskyland' 2025, refill hogshead, 238 btl.) Nose: a very clean example. Lots of lemons and lemon piths, gooseberries and fresh fabrics, alongside velvety notes and nice candle wax. Some seaweed and ginseng. Later also hints of parsley and celeriac. Then back to mild petrol. There's some unripe tropical fruit, but very much in the background.Mouth: a kind of bittersweet mix of apples, grapefruits, bergamot and lime, but also hints of yellow kiwi and lychee (not a combination we see often). Then chilli pepper, lemon grass, all kinds of herbal oils and ointments. A nice degree of coastal and medicinal austerity coupled to more seductive fruits, alongside camphor, tonic water and oriental tea.Finish: long, with slightly sweeter fruits now, some leafy / vegetal notes again, and modest mineral smoke.One of the pure and distillate-driven Springbanks from Decadent Drinks, after a few sherry-forward releases. This combination of slightly exotic fruits with the typical mineral notes is stunning. Available from Decadent Drinks or retailers like The Whisky Exchange. Score: 92/100"

That's why I was so excited to welcome Randy Sullivan to the show today. You might know him from Bourbon Real Talk or his brand, Prideful Goat.

      "summary": "I'm always surprised that 'new' releases from Whisky AGE turn out to be bottled in 2024 or even 2023. Then again, it must take some time before bottles are delivered in Taiwan, and then a bit longer before samples reach Europe again.Today we're having some of the most recent Whisky AGE releases, but also a few that go back longer. Most of them are middle-aged whisky from lesser known distillers. Some of these bottles are still available, better check with the Whisky AGE distributors. Jura 16 yo 2006 (54,2%, Whisky AGE 2023, bourbon barrel #8001643, 214 btl.)Nose: a green and fairly mossy start, along with dried grass and stony hints. Hints of porridge, lemon juice and lime peelings, maybe a hint of rhubarb. A bit of weissbeer. Mustard, earthy notes, freshly cut herbs and metal polish too. Not very classic, but nothing overly funky either.Mouth: more funky now, with plenty of sunflower oil, more mustard and plenty of waxes and paraffin. Then white pepper, an almost peaty and rubbery side and a good dose of bitter extracts. Salty walnuts and grapefruits too. Also a floral, almost perfumed element and some tannins.Finish: medium, quite austere, with some zesty bitterness, pepper, paraffin and a slightly medicinal edge.A difficult dram, starting rather clean but picking up funky flavours along the way. Quite representative for the distillery, but only for grown-ups, I'd say."

      "summary": "Signatory Vintage is now getting a lot of attention for their sherry-driven 100 Proof series. Most of them offer a lot of flavour for a modest price. However, for the releases we're looking at today (an exclusive partnership with The Whisky Exchange), they're focusing on the quality of bourbon casks.The series includes Clynelish, Linkwood and Mortlach. Note that prices are on the higher side here, as if bourbon casks are now the premium exception. Clynelish 17 yo 2008 (53,1%, Signatory Vintage 'Bourbon cask series' for The Whisky Exchange 2025, barrel #800073) Nose: a clean nose, with fresh fruits like peaches and pears. There's also a nice chalky note and a hint of wet rocks, but a slightly lower amount of waxy notes than I was hoping for. Light floral hints and eucalyptus. Then fresh almonds, a subtle hint of honey and subtle coconut shavings.Mouth: vibrant fruity hints again, with a pleasant tart side (green apples, limes, kiwis) couple to mild vanilla and sweeter banana ice cream. Now the waxy character is bigger, always nice. Still some mineral notes and light pepper. Then hints of honey and whiff of sun lotion, and a bit of camphor in the distance.Finish: medium length, lemony and waxy, with some green, leafy hints.I wasn't totally convinced after the nose, with more sweetness and less waxy notes than I was hoping for. However it started growing on me on the palate, so it ends with a nice score. Already sold out at The Whisky Exchange. Linkwood 16 yo 2008 (58,7%, Signatory Vintage 'Bourbon cask series' for The Whisky Exchange 2025, barrel #800064) Nose: quite sweet and rounded, even a little buttery at first. Plenty of apple juice here, with a little kiwi, lemon candy and nice mentholated hints. Then subtle floral notes (fresh laundry and elderflower) along with some lemongrass.Mouth: honeyed and spicy. Sweet caramel with white pepper, apples, tangerines and mirabelles. Some elderflower again. Then also light grassy notes, ginger and a touch of resin. More lemon candy, light caramel and shortbread, even a slightly tropical touch. Overall quite punchy and bright.Finish: medium long, still a bit grassy, but also showing vanilla and more acidic fruits.This one had more complexity than you'd think after a first sip. Bright and easy fruits, but lots of intricate subtleties that make this really attractive. A bit of an insider pick. Still available from The Whisky Exchange. Score: 89/100 Mortlach 21 yo 2003 (58,3%, Signatory Vintage 'Bourbon cask series' for The Whisky Exchange 2025, barrel #800225) Nose: one of these cleaner Mortlachs. Rich pears and mirabelles, hints of dandelions and honeydew. Grows richer, with a bit of butter pastry, sweet chalk and apple compote. Light flowery notes and lime, as well as a synthetic sugary touch.Mouth: more weighty now (in line with Mortlachs meaty reputation) but still showing nice pineapple candy, green banana, honey and gorse flowers as well. Marzipan and vanilla cookies. Perhaps a little more wood than the two others as well, but in a fairly creamy way - no excessive spice.Finish: medium to long, quite rounded again. Some custard and a little toffe with jammy stone fruits.Also pretty great - I'm not the biggest fan of Mortlach's heavy style but I'm really happy with this one. Complexity and roundness combined. Who would have thought the Clynelish would be overtaken by both other whiskies? Available from The Whisky Exchange. Score: 89/100"

      "summary": "Only a few days have gone by since Wu Dram Clan surprised us (well, not really) with the excellent Glen Garioch 2003 single cask, and here is their next release already. This time they're taking us to Islay, with an undisclosed Islay (LA) sourced from the Signatory Vintage warehouses.The addition (LA) is gives us a good indication of the distillery, one that is quite famous among independent bottlers for its excellent 1989-1990-1991-1992 casks. While these casks seem to be less available, Wu Dram Clan managed to find one more. Islay (LA) 34 yo 1990 (51,7%, Signatory Vintage for Wu Dram Clan 2025, bourbon barrel #4342, 221 btl.) Nose: totally in line with expectations. Fine smoky notes in the background and yellow fruits in front row. Mainly citrus but also peach and light vanilla. Then some sunflower oil, as well as a fresh sea breeze with light chalky touches.Mouth: the island character is more robust than expected. Plenty of briny notes and earthiness, along with sharp lemon peels, peppermint and mild antiseptics. Quite vertical, with less tropical fruits than some sister casks. Light mango does appear towards the end, rounded by natural vanilla. Then balanced wood spice, generous smoky notes and herbal sharpness as it fades.Finish: quite long and warming, on herbal tea, citrus peels, black peppercorns and salty peat.Whereas some of these casks give up most of their peatiness in exchange for tropical fruits, this release stays true to its coastal and medicinal origins. The fruitiness is slightly more modest, but nonetheless it's a great release. Around € 650 from several partner shops."

      "summary": "We talk a lot about rarity, allocated bottles, and market prices on this show, but what about the bottles that mean something more? What about the ones that aren't worth a fortune on paper, but hold irreplaceable memories? That's the topic we're diving into today in a really special episode featuring myself, Ryan, and Fred Minnick. Prompted by a listener asking about the significance of bottles beyond their monetary worth, we each opened up our personal collections – not just the unicorns, but the bottles tied to moments in our lives. You'll hear some incredibly personal stories, from Ryan saving a specific bottle for his son's future birthday, to my own reflections on a signed Maker's Mark from my college days, and Fred sharing the significance of a Maker's 46 sample straight from Bill Samuels himself. It's a reminder that while the hunt and the hype are fun, the true value of bourbon often lies in the memories made and the connections shared over a glass. We get into the culture of trading and even touch on the financial side, but ultimately, this conversation is all about the joy, the nostalgia, and the heartfelt connections that make these bottles truly priceless to us. Show Notes: Emotional connections tied to bourbon collections. Personal anecdotes behind treasured bottles. The significance of sharing experiences over rare finds. Fred’s humorous caution about revealing bottle names. Ryan’s Rowan's Creek bottle for his son's future birthday celebration. Kenny’s college memories associated with a signed Maker's Mark. Insights into bourbon trading and its emotional rewards. Celebrating connections formed through memorable bourbon experiences. Candid discussions about the financial aspects of collecting. Reflecting on the joy of bourbon journeys and friendships. Support this podcast on Patreon Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices"

      "summary": "Living Souls is the brand of a new bottler Whisky Souls Ltd, founded by three people with a track record at Douglas Laing, Tullibardine and Loch Lomond Group, among others. They released a first set of bottlings in November 2024 and they've already made a name among whisky enthusiasts.So far they seem to prefer small batch releases and blended whiskies, rather than single casks like other bottlers. We're trying the oldest expression from the inaugural batch, a 40 year old Blended Scotch. The components were married for a very long time (over 25 years) in a ex-Islay sherry butt. It is rumoured to contain about 40% malt whisky from Glenfarclas, Glen Garioch, Fettercairn and Blair Athol. The rest is grain whisky, Cambus and others. Blended Scotch Whisky 40 yo (41,2%, Living Souls 2024, ex-Islay sherry butt)Nose: a cognac-like fruitiness at first. Peaches, nectarines and apricots, with hints of pineapple. Really juicy, with a nice minty layer and hints of eucalyptus - perhaps remnants of faded peat. Orange peels and hints of mouth wash. After a while it becomes rather perfumed, think elderflower and whiffs of lavender. Great vibrance, easy to like so far, but this floral edge is a worrying development.Mouth: easy-going, still lots of bright fruity notes, like pineapple and nectarines, with oranges and a hint of passion fruit. I would be delighted with these tropical notes if not for the clear soapy side that follows closely. Lavender and violets. Then also menthol, white pepper, grainy notes and a pinch of salt. Then a wee smoky puff, with a hint of herbal tea in the end. Pretty bright and hardly sherried, coming accross younger than the claimed age.Finish: medium, with more perfumed notes, hints of liquorice, hoppy elements and a grainy edge.Not the soapiest whisky ever - definitely not FWP territory - but nonetheless it's hard to miss. Even though this Living Souls bottling has a lot going for it (tropical fruits, a skilfull composition and a mild price), soapy notes are the kind of thing that ruins the entire effort for me, even with just a small dose."

      "summary": "Ledaig Hebridean Moon is the first cask strength version of their Ledaig 10 Year Old. It is also interesting because it contains the first spirit drawn from Tobermory's new still, installed in 2014. Maturation took place entirely in second-fill ex-bourbon casks. Sounds good.The team were inspired by Mull’s Baliscate Standing Stones, which are said to be aligned with the lunar cycle, hence the name. Ledaig Hebridean Moon 10 yo (58,8%, OB 2025, refill bourbon casks, 7000 btl.) Nose: a very clean peaty kick, with plenty of lemon zest, smoked tea and lots of sea spray. The citrusy side becomes sweeter after a while, and merges with slightly floral overtones, a bit of birch wood, green walnuts and some sweet pepper in the background. Then hints of leatherette, band-aids and carbon paper. Very fresh and rather accessible so far.Mouth: a lot of punch, of course. Bags of lemons and lemon peelings, with mild vanilla cake, more leather and green apples, maybe even some unripe pineapple. A creamy sweetness runs underneath. Nice hints of antiseptics. Then also mentholated notes, more green nuts and green pepper, along with some light tobacco. Growing pepper and lemon.Finish: long and warming, with some oak spice, citrus freshness and plenty of medicinal peat smoke.A good bottling, I thought this was fresher than the standard 10 Year Old. On par with all of the independent bottlings that gave us such strength (sometimes with a nasty butyric edge). Not cheap, but I like it. Already available from retailers like Royal Mile Whiskies or Tyndrum Whisky."

      "summary": "Maltbarn bottled two Grande Champagne cognacs selected from the stocks of Jean-Luc Pasquet. They are close together: Lot 71 and Lot 72. You may want to check availability in the Maltbarn shop. Cognac Jean-Luc Pasquet 52 yo Lot 72 - Grande Champagne (54,5%, Maltbarn 2025, 75 btl.) Nose: a nice fruity core, with stewed peaches and apricots, ripe apples, quince jam and honey. Mild hints of copper coins and light spearmint. Moderate rancio. Then some sweet almond milk. It's quite vibrant, with a light touch of dried rose petals and citrus peels that keep it bright.Mouth: beautiful tobacco notes take center stage, in a leafy way, combined with mentholated notes. Sour cherries and nectarines, with sultanas and hints of pink pepper. Big Earl Grey notes, some tropical fruits (pink grapefruit, tangerine) and a drop of sweet muscat grapes. Light toffee as well. Gets quite spicy and woody towards the end, with minty / herbal notes.Finish: long, with polished oak and herbal tea, and lingering fruity notes.A really nice all-rounder. There's a sweet candied side but also bright fruity notes. Drier components like tobacco and wood spice are kept at bay. A very good release. Cognac Jean-Luc Pasquet 53 yo Lot 71 - Grande Champagne (55,1%, Maltbarn 2025, 75 btl.) Nose: very close to Lot 72, although this one seems slightly less punchy. Hints of chestnuts and nougat, with light herbs. Underneath the fruitiness is similar - nectarines, ripe apples and quinces. The base aromas are close to Lot 72, but this one can't keep up.Mouth: the onset seems fruitier here. Bergamot, tangerines. Then the minty and spicy side grows bigger than in Lot 72. Less sweetness. Seville oranges. A seductive floral side too, with hints of potpourri and verbena. Later tobacco comes forward, making it drier.Finish: rather long, slightly thinner and brighter than Lot 72, with more bergamot and herbal notes.The added brightness on the palate is very nice, despite also bringing more wood spice. It is mostly the slightly more limited nose that puts this in the shadow of the Lot 71 in my book. Score: 90/100"

      "summary": "In November 2023 the book The Distillation of Whisky 1927–1931 hit the shelves , released by botllers James Eadie. Although it steps outside their usual territory, the book follows their first release, The Distilleries of Great Britain & Ireland: A Journey Through the Heartlands of Whisky 1922–1929. While the first focused on the distilleries themselves, this sequel reveals how whisky was actually produced in the 1920s. James Eadie’s Project 1927 tries to replicate the style of whisky from the 1920s by following the ideas and practices described in this book. The whiskies were distilled between autumn 2023 and spring 2024 at Ardnamurchan, Dornoch, Holyrood, InchDairnie, Lochlea, and an unnamed farm distillery in Fife. Each distillery used locally grown barley or heritage 1920s varieties, along with brewer’s yeast — a staple back then but rarely used in whisky-making today. The team filled them into refill American new oak and refill oloroso European oak casks. The entire set is still available from Royal Mile Whiskies among others. Ardnamurchan new make (63,4%, James Edie 'Project 1927') Nose: the first thing that struck me was the vegetal side. Hints of boiled beans and something fatty. However, these are common newmake notes and - especially in comparison to the others - this is a bold spirit but actually quite fresh. Beer mash and corn flakes, along with hints of dried herbs (cumin) and lemons clearly lifting this spirit. Then in the background there's a vague roasted note and something lightly cheesy. Overall a nicely oily impression and a nice herbal freshness.Mouth: quite weighty and thick, despite the obvious alcohol. The herbal character quickly comes out, along with a mineral / stoney quality. Black pepper heat, a briny note and scorched rosemary. Leather. Underneath there's a fresher (sourish) hint of grapefruit and green apple.Finish: medium length, bittersweet, also showing mint and pepper. Turpentine and drying cocoa in the end.On the nose I really liked this Ardnamurchan spirit a lot. On the palate I found the sharpness a little less impressive, even though the weight is usually a nice sign for ageing potential. Score: ++ Dornoch new make (63,4%, James Edie 'Project 1927') Nose: slightly sweeter and less herbal than the Ardnamurchan spirit, with a mild hint of mashed banana and kiwi. Then also green orange peels, plenty of green bell peppers, hints of mezcal and some herbs. Big mashy notes too, with vague hints of fruitiness already down there.Mouth: still rich, but clearly juicier than the Ardnamurchan. Briny herbs again, but also hints of fruit eau-de-vie at some point, albeit with a mineral fingerprint and a vague smoky echo. Very young orujo notes. Some pepper, pickles and gin-like botanicals like juniper and mint.Finish: medium length, still quite vibrant. Also leathery notes and a mild toffee sweetness. Back to leafy / vegetal notes in the end.A very characterful spirit, as expected from the Thompson brothers. At some point it reminded me of not-yet-whiskies from Asia, such as Shizuoka. Only the Lochlea spirit topped this one, it will be interesting how they evolve in wood. Score: +++ Holyrood new make (63,4%, James Edie 'Project 1927') Nose: agave notes and lemons, then more cabbage and creamy malt, with a clear cheesy hint up front. It settles down though, bringing along hints of thyme and mint leaves. A bit flatter than the others perhaps, but again there's an onset of (pineapple) fruitiness in the background.Mouth: one of the fruitier spirits. Perhaps a hint of peach eau-de-vie and citrus, really nice. Mid-palate a peatier element sets in, with hints of roasted grains and firm hints of liquorice. A faint hint of mouldy flowers too.Finish: quite long and medicinal, on sweet citrus, grapes, herbal bitters and hints of agave.Certainly funky on the nose, but the innate fruity note makes up for part of it. Initially it made a nice impression, but the longer I worked on them, the more it was overtaken by others. Complexity isn't the highest either. Score: ++ Balgothrie / Inchdairnie new make (63,4%, James Edie 'Project 1927') Nose: far less vegetal now, far less 'old era' too. This starts with some dusty grains, leather, chalky notes and citrus. Then papery elements, something vaguely woody (balsa), subtle botanicals and an inviting sweetness that almost hints at vanilla custard.Mouth: oily and sweet, with both the pastry note and a berry sweetness, along with sweet citrus. Then a slight cardboard note, as well as aniseed and black pepper growing stronger. Also a mentholated note.Finish: not long, back to boozy sweet grains, lemon peels and mild spice.Surprisingly different from the others, perhaps because of the shorter fermentation and the yeast strain. None of the funky notes that the previous three samples had, making this considerably more easy-going but also less interesting within the entire experiment. Score: ++ Lochlea new make (63,4%, James Edie 'Project 1927') Nose: somewhere in the middle between funk and a more classic style. Very inviting hints of lime and mint leaves, with just a hint of chalk and apple. Also fresh laundry. There's some of that vegetal character as well, hidden underneath.Mouth: berry sweetness with plenty of citrus, green apple and even a hint of passion fruits. Hints of bubble gum. Then a little marzipan, more apple (candy), blueberries and the usual spiciness.Finish: medium and clean, nicely fruity, always very bright and approachable.So far I haven't been convinced of Lochlea's single malts, but this is a nice newmake. Somewhat less complex than others, for sure, but it shows a lot of balance, elegance and very vibrant fruits. My favourite in this series when it comes to instant drinkability. Score: ++++ Unnamed farm distillery in Fife new make (63,4%, James Edie 'Project 1927') Nose: some coppery notes, grapes and vegetal / leafy hints (bell peppers again). Fairly complex and at the same time quite gentle. There's also an earthy base note, without becoming too heavy. Then drops of honey and cane sugar. Among the nicer noses in the line-up.Mouth: nice texture, sweet and spicy, with a salty side as well. Still some coppery notes again, along with berries, a bit of pepper and cinnamon. Then it moves towards brown sugar (giving it a rummy character) and back to some very clean barley notes.Finish: on the short side, with more neutral barley, a caramel-like sweetness and mild nutmeg.From Daftmill comes this clean and balanced spirit. So balanced in fact that it will almost certainly mature into a beautiful whisky when given enough time in moderately active wood. Not necessarily standing out at this point, unless you're looking for balance. Score: +++ The last sample in the box is a 'blended at birth' spirit. Not all distilleries have an equal part in this: Lochlea and Inchdarnie each contribute 28%, Holyrood 19%, Ardnamurchan 16% and the others just a few percent. Blended At Birth - six new make spirits (63,4%, James Edie 'Project 1927') Nose: a bit of everything indeed. Citrus brightness stand out, the vegetal notes are rather mellow, there is some aniseed and mint. Then also a mild mineral note, spearmint and vague fruity notes in the background (apple and peach).Mouth: going in different directions. Now the spicy notes seem to become quite loud (pepper, nutmeg), but also herbal elements that add some bitterness. The more unique fruits are now wiped out, but there is some caramel and berry sweetness. Then also a pungency that I didn't get in any of the components, but that is probably just the sum of different parts.Finish: medium to long, still slightly bittersweet, with flashes of citrus and aniseed coming back.This is a difficult excercise, of course. I was more impressed by the more delicate spirits, but these loose their voice in such a crowded blend. Then again the ones with a peculiar character only have a modest portion. Trying this as a blend is not the point, in my opinion, the individual spirits have more to say on their own. Score: ++ Afterthoughts I tried these samples in the same order they were in the tasting kit. However I'm not sure that was the right order, as some of the funky spirits came first and the last ones seemed more accessible.Anyway, how do you score newmake spirits? Is it the quality and complexity of the current product (which would mean they get a 70-ish score), or do you try to think forward and predict the potential evolution, assuming some of the harsh vegetal notes will probably become milder and fruits may become louder? I mostly looked at their current state, since we don't know the type of wood being used. That said, a vague score seems better here than a specific score on a 0-100 scale.Overall Project 1927 is an interesting idea, but a tasting kit with seven newmakes is definitely very geeky. Regardless of your experience with (mature) single malts, assessing newmake is an entirely different challenge - overall they're closer together than most single malts, in my opinion. To be honest I wouldn't drink any of these spirits on their own - even comparing them at full strength becomes a little tough after a while. So once I had two comparative sessions I had a considerable amount of spirit left. That leaves me wondering about the audience and the interest in such kits."

      "summary": "The Wild Blue is a new limited edition from Talisker. It underlines the distillery's salty and smoky DNA with a 16-month finish in South African red wine casks, used in wineries near the Atlantic coast.Like Talisker Wilder Seas, each bottle includes a £3 donation to the Blue Marine Foundation, which supports the restoration of coastal and marine habitats. The bottle is 100% recycled glass. I guess it gives you a better look at the E150 coloured spirit. Talisker The Wild Blue (48,2%, OB 2025, Atlantic Coastal wine finish) Nose: red fruits are easy to notice. Some juicy figs, sultanas and hints of raspberry ganache. This goes nicely along iodine and smoked bacon, mild ashes and hints of sweet wood spice. Black peppercorns. Red berry candy. Then fresh citrus notes and whiffs of menthol, as well as pipe tobacco in the background. A nice nose.Mouth: instant black pepper - good. Then red fruits again, although less sweet than I expected. More towards cranberries, grapes and pickled lemons. Mid-palate a tangy winey note appears, along with a bitter edge. Then a hint of cough syrup, coastal smoke and poached pears. In the end the tannins and oaky grip becomes a tad harsh.Finish: medium, on sweet smoke, black pepper, charcoal smoke and leathery dryness.As you know red wine finishes start with a disadvantage in my book, and if there's one distillery that doesn't need such finishes, it's Talisker. On the nose this whisky did convince me, but on the palate it becomes a bit too winey for my taste. At least the typical Talisker markers are strong enough to withstand most of the wine. Available from The Whisky Exchange for instance. I got a sample from Whiskysite.nl."

      "summary": "Gordon & MacPhail just released the fifth and final release in the Mr George Legacy. The 1953, 1957, 1958 and 1959 reached some of the highest scores on this blog. This series saw the light in 2021 and now comes to an end.The new addition is a Glen Grant 1954, again paying tribute to George Urquhart's legacy for the success of single malts. This is 70 years old, no less! Back in 1954 it was filled into a fresh sherry puncheon - the fact that whisky stays such a long time in first-fill wood without becoming undrinkable, is almost unbelievable. It is a testimony of Mr George's understanding of spirit and wood.The final bottling has an outturn of only 130 bottles, making it even more desirable. Glen Grant 70 yo 1954 'Mr George Legacy' (50,5%, Gordon & MacPhail 2025, first fill sherry puncheon #1823, 130 btl.) Nose: classic furniture polish at first - always a great element. This combines nicely with hints of prunes in armagnac and plenty of sweet and sour berry notes. Blueberry pastry but also fresh raspberries and nice cherry jam (after some time). Then also mint and eucalyptus oils, orange peels and clove. Leather, walnuts, cigar boxes and beeswax too. Subtle rose petals and herbal honey. Roughly the same aromas we found in the previous editions, but this is a particularly vibrant edition.Mouth: plenty of tobacco leaves now, mixed with mentholated notes and dark chocolate. Then there's also a bright hint of pink grapefruit, sour cherry and red apple. Subtle coffee notes and liquorice in the background. Dried herbs with dark chocolate. Whiffs of cask smoke, with gingerbread and flashes of pink grapefruit. Really beautiful - it brings back memories of the Book of Kells releases.Finish: medium length, with more hints of oriental wood, blackberries and old leather. Lingering leafy notes and mint as well.Now this is already the third 70 year-old Glen Grant I've tried thanks to Gordon & MacPhail, but it's the first with such a dark sherry influence. This 1954 gives us glorious sherry, with an ethereal nose that you can keep smelling for hours. On the palate there's a lot of depth as well, from dark and slightly smoky notes to vibrant berry fruits. Overall an impressive finale to this series, only slightly behind the outstanding 1953 in my opinion. Head over to Gordon & MacPhail for more information. Also available from retailers like The Whisky Exchange.Just for fun: my personal ranking would be: 1953 (95/100), 1954 (94/100) and then the 1957 / 1958 / 1959 (all 93/100)."

      "summary": "I asked ChatGPT to write a WhiskyNotes-style introduction (no kidding) and this is the result...Two new Smögen releases from the folks at Decadent Drinks — a name that's quickly become synonymous with characterful selections. This time we’re looking at a 2014 and a 2016 vintage, both distilled at Sweden’s Smögen distillery, known for its muscular, heavily peated spirit. Let’s see how these two Nordic beasts perform in the glass. Smögen 10 yo 2014 (57,1%, Decadent Drinks 'Decadent Drams' 2024, Madeira hogshead / refill hogshead, 166 btl.) Nose: heavily peated in an elegant way, with lots of eucalyptus and green pine wood, as well as a salty edge, light mentholated notes and hints of polished Ifé wood. Motor oil and smoked bacon too. Then apricots and bright citrus in the background, with some burnt orange peel.Mouth: oily and coastal peat, again showing this refreshing mintiness and pepperiness that balances the smoke. Green peppercorns, along with plenty of citrus oils. Mid-palate the tarry side becomes stronger, with liquorice, salty brine and seaweed. Then pink grapefruits and sour plums.Finish: long and sooty, with a sliver of salty wood and light herbal notes.This very precise style of Smögen again. Despite the heavy peat it manages to bring along some citrus fruits, coastal notes and this peculiar Nordic herbal element. Really good. Still available from Decadent Drinks or The Whisky Exchange for instance. Smögen 8 yo 2016 (57,1%, Decadent Drinks 'Decadent Drams' 2024, Oloroso quarter casks / second-fill sherry hogshead, 172 btl.) Nose: the Oloroso is on top. There's tobacco, some coppery notes and red berries. Subtle industrial smoke, with more engine oil and nice car workshop aromas. Something musty and even a little cheesy, but it doesn't bother me. Then big hints of soy sauce, smoked meat and fresh tar.Mouth: a lot of umami notes again. Smoked meat, a salty berry note, earthy peat and plenty of pipe tobacco. Hints of caramelized fruits (maybe dates), cold coffee and charred oranges and black pepper. Then smoked herbs appear, although the Nordic side is less prominent here.Finish: long, salty and tarry, with some dark sweetness in the distance.A bit peculiar again, but so much fun. Dirtier than the Madeira version, for sure. When forced to choose I would pick the other one because it's more typical in my opinion, but both are definitely worth discovering. Sold out, I believe. Score: 89/100"

      "summary": "Wu Dram Clan have had a few relaxed months but now they're back with a special release. This Glen Garioch 2003 is the first single cask release from the distillery for an independent bottler. I'm always a bit weary of such claims, it all depends how you define it, but it's a rare sight in any case.We're looking at a first fill Oloroso sherry butt which yielded 681 bottles in total. Only 250 bottles are were available through German retailers and the rest sits on the shelves of the distillery shop. Glen Garioch 21 yo 2003 (53,9%, OB for Wu Dram Clan 2024, first fill Oloroso sherry butt #808, 681 btl.) Nose: quite powerful, with dark raisins and plums, along with black cherries. Spicy chocolate with bits of hazelnut comes through, as well as herbal honey. Then there's quite a generous amount of oak spice as well, with firm ginger and nutmeg, whiffs of cedar and a hint of pine resin. Light leathery notes too.Mouth: even more balanced than the nose suggested. Just a perfect mix of sweeter and drier Oloroso elements, like leather, black peppercorns and plenty of nice tobacco. Then also brighter hints of orange peels, Timut pepper, blackberries, prunes and chestnut honey. Raisins and ginger cake too. Deep flavours and above average complexity, but always in a nicely rounded way.Finish: long, slightly drier again, with caramelized nuts, pepper, mild espresso and more tobacco.While the nose suggested a dark and dry whisky, there's actually a really vibrant side to it on the palate. A nicely creamy, juicy and relatively fruity Glen Garioch with a great balance. Excellent choice. WDC's partner retailers can be found here but I'm afraid all bottles were gone in the blink of an eye."

I was able to pick up a sample set with a few 2024 releases.We start with an Aultmore 14 Years. This combines two 2008 rye barrels with a third of a 2009 Oloroso seasoned octave (the rest of which is bottled for Dornoch Castle). Next up: two 25+ year old whiskies from Inchgower and Ardmore. Aultmore 14 yo 2008+2009 (48,5%, Thompson Bros 2024, first fill rye barrel + Oloroso octave)Nose: an interesting balance of spice and sherry. Brown bread, leathery notes, along with plenty of nutty notes. Walnuts, hazelnuts. Vegetal oils. Then some green olives, nougat and orange peels. Rather savoury with a fairly lightweight profile.Mouth: more spice now. White pepper (evolving towards chilli), hints of nutmeg and ginger. Orange peels return, with roasted pumpkin bread, almonds and hints of marmelade. A hint of spiced honey. Then also a winey edge, perhaps the combination of spice and sherry that gives it a tannic impression. Hardly any fruits.Finish: spicy, with hay and a hint of milk chocolate. Medium length.A fairly savoury style of sherry, more towards Amontillado than Oloroso. The lack of fruits and the rye influence make this a rather uncommon whisky."

      "summary": "Malternative Belgium was recently in the spotlight with two new bottlings. One is an undisclosed cognac for a Dutch retailer, and the other was their own release.The first is a Lot 74 from a forgotten dame jeanne in a traditional chai at the heart of the Grande Champagne. It was selected by Stefan & Michel at Passion for Whisky. Cognac Lot 74 - Grande Champagne (40,64%, Malternative Belgium for Passion for Whisky 2024, 48 btl.) Nose: a grapey start, with stewed apricots evolving towards ripe figs. Then hints of flower petals, apple compote and honey. Light vanilla with herbal notes (thyme and chamomile), as well as golden sultanas. Fine leather comes out as it darkens, with a hint of coffee beans as well. Mouth: more on the rustic side of Grande Champagne, I'd say. Caramelized notes, plums and polished wood, honey and liquorice. Sweetened herbal tea, sultanas again and star anise. Rather rounded, but it gradually becomes drier, on walnuts and citrus peels. A hint of pine in the end.Finish: still a hint of fir wood and eucalyptus, but also cinnamon, jammy fruits and roasted nuts. Quite long.A nice find from a very small producer. Out of stock, I'm afraid. Given the outturn and the quality not very surprising. Next up: cognac from Fins Bois, sourced from the stocks at Rémi Landier. It is a micro-vatting of three harvests, similar to the duo we saw in the Journal des Kirsch series. Cognac Rémi Landier L72-73-74 - Fins Bois (50,13%, Malternative Belgium 2025, 350 btl.) Nose: more refined, with brighter fruits. Think quinces, greengages, Williams pears and nectarines. Rich floral notes as well, with fragrant grape must and whiffs of polished oak. Then there's also a beautiful waxy side of paraffin and candles. Very seductive.Mouth: the waxy texture stays strong, albeir with a punchy hint of pepper, ginger and some grassy notes as well. Then back to rich fruits - apricots on syrup and mirabelles. Hints of marzipan, light caramel and vanilla. Oak spice, mint and drying leafy notes towards the end.Finish: long, still sweet and fruity, with honey and orange peels. Light menthol and furniture polish too.A lovely texture here, taken to a higher level by a typical Fins Bois kind of floral note and fruits. Always elegant. The mix of different harvests makes this a true all-rounder. Available from today at Malternative Belgium. Score: 90/100"

      "summary": "Signatory Vintage is really spoiling whisky fans with their 100 Proof series. They keep releasing high strength sherry bombs at an incredible pace and at an incredible price. Some might even say they're ruining the market, since very few independent bottlers can match this price / quality ratio. Signatory has a vast array of casks and they do master the recipe of a good sherry bomb.We look at two of their recent offerings: Glenlossie 2012 and Craigellachie 2014."

For your information, the abolition of slavery slowed down sugar and rum production on the island significantly, which meant Jamaica was overtaken by Guyana and Martinique as biggest rum suppliers."

      "summary": "In September 2024 Bimber unveiled the second release of its Shoulders of Giants series. It pays homage to thinkers, innovators and visionaries who have shaped our world.We have more than six samples waiting to be reviewed, but today we'll go for three pairs: two bourbon casks, two Oloroso casks and two Pedro Ximénez casks. To make these pairs, we also include Copernicus which is from the first batch.Mind that a lot of these bottlings are exclusive to a certain country: Darwin, Winston and Victoria were only available in the UK, Ludwig in Germany and Witkiewicz in Poland. Bimber 'Ludwig - The Composer' (58,7%, OB 'Shoulders of Giants' 2024, ex-bourbon cask #402, 242 btl.) Nose: pretty vibrant, with vanilla and rich stewed fruits. Apricots, pears on syrup and melons, as well as hints of pineapple cubes. Then butter pastry (maybe waffles) with minty notes and white pepper. Coconut cream and caramel.Mouth: sweet and spicy. Plenty of vanilla again, with barley sugar, red apples and sweet citrus. Mid-palate the oak spices take over: white pepper becomes chilli, along with some alcohol burn. Fresh oak shavings too, with a subtle sour edge and nutmeg. Very oak-driven, up to the point where it echoes American bourbon whiskey.Finish: medium length, with sharp spice and generous wood. Hints of citrus rind and a subtle astringency;Active bourbon wood, bringing plenty of vanilla and even more wood spice to the table. The trademark Bimber fruits are also present. Good but the spice is not very subtle. I always saw Beethoven as a sherry character, but this has a nice turbulence that fits him. Bimber 'Darwin - The Naturalist' (58,3%, OB 'Shoulders of Giants' 2024, ex-bourbon cask #376, 259 btl.) Nose: similar sweetness. Pastry notes, a hint of maple syrup and loads of vanilla. Then honey, apricots and mango. Hints of mocha cream and marzipan, as well as candied ginger, white pepper and cinnamon.Mouth: fairly thick, almost liqueur-like at times, with a lot of oak spice again, but better integrated than Ludwig. Butter pastry, red apples and sweet orange candy. Similar minty bourbon notes and caramelized nuts.Finish: medium length, with more mint and aniseed. Citrus and banana candy in the background.Quite modern again, with a lot of active wood and a bit of a hybrid profile. A big profile and slightly more balanced than Ludwig. Score: 86/100 Bimber 'Winston - The Statesman' (58,5%, OB 'Shoulders of Giants' 2024, Spanish Oloroso sherry cask #473, 302 btl.) Nose: very dark aromas - prunes, blackberry jam and dates, with dark chocolate and hints of sherry brandy. Chocolate coated raisins, hazelnut paste, black pepper and marzipan. Then a bit cherry liqueur too. Reminds me of some Glendronach single casks.Mouth: plenty of dark forest fruits mixed with dark cocoa again. Getting quite leafy, with tobacco and hints of roasted nuts. A whiff of cask smoke even. Then some leathery dryness, coffee beans and a little aniseed.Finish: quite long and dark, with dark jammy fruits. Black pepper and light tannins emerge as well, but they are not taking over.Heavily sherried, with a lot of chocolate. Overall it shows a good balance of savoury notes and sweetness. A nice example of how good seasoned casks can become. Score: 87/100 Bimber 'Witkiewicz - The Artist' (58,7%, OB 'Shoulders of Giants' 2024, Spanish Oloroso sherry cask #460, 285 btl.) Nose: despite being peated, this has a slightly lighter profile, with more cigar boxes and wood polish but less of that chocolaty weight. Blackcurrants and raisins, with hints of burnt vanilla pastry underneath. Fig jam, toast, a little library dust and caramel.Mouth: nice tobacco notes, more cigar boxes and dark sugar. Then more raisins, black cherries and prunes. Now some chocolate too, along with cinnamon and dry smoke. This one reminds me of Highland Park. Dried fruits and hints of marmalade come out towards the end.Finish: quite long. Tobacco and mild smoke, with black pepper and a berry sweetness.Peated Bimber is quite rare, but it combines nicely with the sherry cask. Overall this stands out in this session - a nice highlight already. Score: 88/100 Bimber 'Copernicus - The Polymath' (56,8%, OB 'Shoulders of Giants' 2023, Pedro Ximénez cask #241, 300 btl.) Nose: more elegant than expected. Dried fruits of course - prunes, raisins, cherry liqueur and dates, but also a fragrant, almost floral edge. Leathery notes perhaps. Then hints of gingerbread, bramble and orange peels. Very good.Mouth: typical PX sweetness. Blackcurrant jam, prunes, toffee and mocha candy. On the other hand there's also vanilla sweetness, maple syrup and a sweet oakiness. Then ginger comes out, along with leather and milk chocolate.Finish: long, perhaps a tad too drying. Moving towards coffee, stewed peaches and dark cocoa, with a leathery note in the background.This mixes PX notes with the heavyweight American oak markers. Remember this is 'merely' a PX finish so there's always some bourbon wood involved as well. Score: 87/100 Bimber 'Victoria - The Monarch' (57,9%, OB 'Shoulders of Giants' 2024, Pedro Ximénez cask #450, 298 btl.) Nose: well behaved again. Hints of Kahlua, raisins, with black cherries and muscovado sugar. Some of the blackberry jam and sherry brandy of Winston as well. Then poached pear and whiffs of polished exotic wood.Mouth: toffee with baked apple and milk chocolate. Then hazelnuts and latte notes, raisins and black pepper. It becomes fruitier after a while, but it quickly moves back to brown sugar and cinnamon pastry.Finish: quite long, with more cinnamon and latte, but thinner than Copernicus.Good whisky again, but this seems to have a lower complexity than the others. So there, no crescendo but good scores accross the board. Score: 86/100"

      "summary": "At the Whisky Fair in Germany, a couple of weeks ago, Maltbarn presented its latest batch of whisky bottlings. A few of them have labels that refer to famous music albums, and these are the ones we'll be trying first.There are familiar names, as Maltbarn tends to release similar casks (or parts of casks) several times over the course of a few years. However there's also Glen Mosset - a name that we've only seen with Maltbarn so far, if I'm not mistaken. It appears to be the disguise of Benromach. Glenlossie 29 yo 1995 (49,2%, Maltbarn 2025, bourbon cask, 156 btl.)Nose: very aromatic, with plenty of sweet pears, vineyard peaches, quinces, as well as some more tropical notes (bananas). Later it moves towards apricots with waxy undertones (crayons). A little chamomile tea as well. Then also a hint of women's cream, something blossomy that you get in very old bourbon casks. A great profile.Mouth: sunflower oil mixed with lemon juice, something gristy and green banana. Sweet at first, but the grassy side of the spirit makes it move towards bittersweet notes. Grapefruit, a chalky touch, some green tea and ginger. A hint of quinine?Finish: not too long, but crisp, nicely mixing mint, lemon peels and some oaky sweetness.Pretty much in line with the Glenlossie 1992 they released a couple of years ago. An excellent profile with the seductive side of long ageing but also a punk edge. Exactly."

      "summary": "In this episode, we sit down with Amine Karaoud, the founder behind Old Louisville Whiskey Company. Amine's path is unorthodox, transitioning from a safe career in engineering to living a life behind the counter of a struggling liquor store in Old Louisville. At that store, he learned about the business and how to navigate the three tier system. He also had some foresight where he took profits from the store and started buying barrels at MGP years ago but he didn't know what to do with them. Fast forward a few years, he's got a healthy stock of double digit aged barrels and an idea of creating a new brand. His past life with the retail ingrained a sense of hospitality which is one of the reasons why he has fostered a community that grabs up all his releases. Show Notes: What inspired your move from engineering to the whiskey industry? How did you revitalize the liquor store you took over? What obstacles did you encounter while launching your whiskey brand? Can you elaborate on your barrel sourcing strategy? Why did you choose to build your own distillery instead of using co-packers? What role does community engagement play in your business? Insights into your blending process and the importance of mash bills. How has your retail experience influenced your whiskey offerings?

Casks are coming from the defunct Imperial distillery, the soon to be revived Tormore and Bladnoch distillery. Imperial 26 yo 1998 (49,8%, Decadent Drinks 'Whiskyland' 2025, refill barrel, 134 btl.)Nose: waxy fruits - always a safe bet when it comes to Decadent Drinks releases. Melons, (slightly green) bananas and dried pineapples, white and yellow flowers, as well as some natural vanilla and a whiff of varnish. Then citrus oils (grapefruit) and peach skins with subtle hints of summery grass and canvas too.Mouth: excellent fruitiness with a creamy texture and a subtle acidity. More green bananas, apples, mirabelles and plenty of mineral oils. Candle wax, obviously. Then it moves towards citrus peelings, herbal honey, lemongrass and some leafy hints. Vanilla, ginger and a subtle hint of wood. Pineapple and grassy green tea towards the end.Finish: medium to long, on the same elements. Floral fruits, a subtle green edge and waxy notes.Quintessential Imperial from the last year of production. Highly drinkable (medium complexity) but not too soft - this is a naturally low strength after all. I could have this any time, especially with the summer around the corner. Available from Decadent Drinks or retailers like Master of Malt."

      "summary": "A quick stop in Campbeltown for some of the latest Kilkerran releases. While Batch 11 is generally referred to as the first 2025 release (since that's when they became available) they were actually bottled Winter 2024. Kilkerran 8 yo Cask Strength - Bourbon Cask Matured (55,6%, OB 2024, Batch #11, ref. 24/262) Nose: chalky and oily, with a coastal salinity and a fresh hint of green apple, rhubarb and sweet lemons. Maybe pineapple. Then Chamois leather and leafy notes, with hints of muddy water, rapeseed and wet tweed jackets. Light bready notes and subtle natural vanilla. Light peat smoke too, of course.Mouth: nicely balanced for such a funky profile at high strength. Minerals, wet limestone and salt, but the thick oily texture and the sweetness of the bourbon casks makes this so easily quaffable. Sweet dough, grapefruit juice and a bit of black pepper heat. A few drops of mezcal too.Finish: long and chalky, with more grapefruits, juniper berries, white pepper and some bitter herbal touches.Very reliable whisky, year after year. It doesn't hide its youth but it has that typical Campbeltown funk. In fact, I think it's on the same level as Springbank spirit with the advantage of being easier to find. Roughly the same appreciation of the 2023 release. Available from The Whisky Exchange for instance. Kilkerran Heavily Peated (57,9%, OB 2024, Batch #11, ref. 24/201) Nose: a bit lactic at first (butter milk - not my favourite tasting note), along with a fishy note and lemon balm and dessert. Then freshly mown lawn, grapefruits and gooseberries. Definitely peated and medicinal but maybe less heavily than expected - it's a cold style of smoke, along with iodine and hints of lime pickle.Mouth: cleaner, with a bright fruity burst amidst the peat blast. Pineapple, pear and lime, maybe passion fruits even. Honeyed notes, even a light confectionary edge. Then salty notes come out, as well as deeper sooty / smoky elements. Brine and smoked fish. Black pepper and ginger, along with drying herbs in the end.Finish: long and briney, on citrus notes, green banana, peat smoke and minerals.While also predominantly bourbon matured (90% with 10% sherry), this felt less precise on the nose. On the palate it was good to see some tropical fruitiness, but it doesn't convince me entirely. Overall a bit behind the 2024 release. Sold out in most online shops. Score: 86/100"

      "summary": "The Chinese whisky industry is still in its infancy. However, with demand for whisky in general rising in China (x3 in ten years), their own production is also surfing this wave. Will consumers switch from the immensely popular Baijiu to Chinese single malts?In 2019 Pernod Ricard started The Chuan distillery and in 2021 Diageo announced its plans for the Eryuan distillery. Both are large scale projects that will probably boost the category of Chinese whisky. It will probably also set higher standards, as Chinese regulations for what is called 'whisky' are not exactly strict.Today we look at the relatively small Dongwei distillery, which started production in summer 2020 (although a micro distillery had already been running since 2014). Their pair of copper stills were designed and hand-made by the owner Weidong 'Ricky' Wei himself. While being a 'native' project, Dongwei already seems to use much higher standards by only releasing whisky after at least six years of maturartion.They use Chinese grown barley (mostly 6-row from Northwest China, now also other types from Hunan) with direct gas-fired distillation and a variety of yeast and oak combinations. They even use Mongolian oak and they're trying to find a truly Chinese identity with certain oak types as well.I got seven cask samples from 2014, 2016 and 2017, but sadly not a lot of info. You can hardly find any images of actual bottles that aren't blocked to European visitors, for instance. Most of my information comes from their mobile website, which seems to be easier to use than their desktop version."

      "summary": "Holyrood distillery opened in 2019 as the first new distillery in Edinburgh in nearly one hundred years. They quickly earned a reputation for their Holyrood gin. Later they introduced a series of new make spirits, experimenting with heirloom barley or different yeast types.Since October 2023 a lot of effort is put into bringing their single malt whisky to the market. Recently they launched The Founding Series: three single malts that represent a wide variety of flavour profiles.The first is Holyrood Ambir, a combination of first-fill and second-fill bourbon barrels, with Oloroso butts and hogsheads. It features classic distillers malt with five specialty malts (chocolate malt, Vienna, Crystal 240, Highland peated and caramalt) in an effort to create a sweet and creamy whisky.I like the fact that they're experimenting and researching, but it seems their current compositions are perhaps a little too wide. I mean: six malt types and no less than ten yeast strains - kudos for the transparency but will they will have an individual impact? On the other hand there's plenty of room for more specific releases, right? Holyrood Ambir (49,8%, OB 2024, bourbon + Oloroso casks) Nose: a bit of a musty start, with plenty of creamy fudge indeed. Buttery caramel, bruised apples and a grapey note. A lactic note too. Then brown bread, beer wort and brown sugar, along with blueberry jam. Hints of shortbread and cake with lemon frosting. A rather curious ensemble.Mouth: rather young, with some big grainy elements - cornflakes as they suggest themselves - roasted grains and more buttery cake. Then there are spicy notes (ginger, white pepper, gin botanicals) along with a vegetal note and a mildly bitter edge. A bit of lemon zest and a subtle hint of dark chocolate / mocha in the end.Finish: medium, with more burnt biscuit notes, a savoury touch, dark tea and pepper.Certainly not the classic cornerstone expression that other distilleries are bringing out. Maybe not an instant crush but quite an intruiging whisky. Available from The Whisky Exchange or Royal Mile Whiskies for instance. Holyrood Pitch is the newest (and final) addition to the Founding series. It uses pot malt and brown malt (commonly used in Porter beers) with two yeast typically reserved for red wine (Pepe Nero and Toro Nero). Add Oloroso casks and we're in for a rich and nutty whisky. Holyrood Pitch (49,4%, OB 2024, Oloroso casks) Nose: a little more classic, and more sherried too. There's blackberry and milk chocolate, with hints of raisins and plenty of cold coffee in the background. Then hints of muesli with some roasted nuts and black peppercorns.Mouth: now the roasted side is really on top. Plenty of coffee beans, dark cocoa nibs, even a little tobacco. Some dried fruits and orange peels underneath. Then hints of Porter beer, with more chocolate ganache and roasted nuts.Finish: quite long, dark and roasted, with oak spice and coffee pastry.Slightly spin-doctored again, but I think this is much more successful. The roasted element is quite powerful (at some point it reminded me of Glenmorangie Signet) and gets further enhanced by the sherry casks. Well made. Available from Royal Mile Whiskies or LMdW for instance. Score: 86/100 We kept the smoky whisky until the end: Holyrood Embra. Here they used a diverse range of yeasts and added a number of ex-Islay casks to get a mild smoky element. Holyrood Embra (43,6%, OB 2024, first-fill bourbon + peated quarter casks + virgin American oak) Nose: sweet lemons with mild, ashy smoke. Hints of pears, gooseberries and green apple, as well as a fresh whiff of menthol. Then orange peels and vanilla. Even a light floral touch.Mouth: fairly mild again (Caol Ila style), with a lighter texture than the ones before. Leafy notes with smouldering bonfires. Hints of white pepper, more lemons again, along with hints of burnt toast. The smoke gets louder towards the end, with a mild hint of vegetal bitterness.Finish: short to medium, combining toasted nuts, earthy woodsmoke, lemon and black pepper.Given the experimental take of the others, this had a light, even slightly docile nose. On the palate there's more smoke to be found. This Embra has less personality than the others, I'd say, which makes it a good option if you're new to peat or simply want a smoky springtime whisky. Available from The Whisky Exchange or Royal Mile Whiskies for instance. Score: 83/100"

They're launching them in order of \"weight\", starting with Pedro Ximénez (which needs less time to leave a mark), followed by Palo Cortado.The third release is the Amontillado version. Allow me to refresh your memory: Amontillado is a kind of over-aged Fino sherry, influenced by a period of biological ageing (under flor) as well as oxidative ageing (with air contact, much like an Oloroso). All casks were sourced from their usual sherry cask supplier Miguel Martín."

      "summary": "You're probably reading the title to this podcast going, what? a podcast from 2018? Yes, this is a never before aired episode that Ryan and I recorded at Bourbon Bonanza back in 2018. So here's the story. Bourbon Bonanza was an offshoot event that would happen during Kentucky Bourbon Festival but wasn't associated with the festival. It was tied in with Willett so there were a lot of influential people at the time that came to this event. Ryan and I took our equipment, plus our very first release of Pursuit Series, into what was Harrison-Smith House at the time which is now the new Chicken Cock visitor center and we sat down with Bill Thomas of Jack Rose in Washington DC and Mike Miller of Delilah's in Chicago, who still to this day run the most successful whiskey bars in the country. There is also a small appearance by Tatsumi at the very end and you will hear his story as a part of this episode. The sound environment was challenging and I wasn't happy with how the audio turned out. Let's fast forward almost 7 years and audio cleanup software has gotten so good that it's now time to release it. We talk about the festival, barrel picks, community, and trends they were seeing at the time. So here you go, a blast from the past with an unreleased archive episode.

Not only did founder John Glaser sell his share, some of the long-time hits like Hedonism and Spice Tree were discontinued due to stock limitations. Instead the company presented a new core range, composed of Peat Monster and Orchard House as well as a new Crimson Casks (a sherry-forward blended malt) and today's Compass Box Nectarosity.Nectarosity is a blended Scotch. It revolves around Highland malts (Clynelish, Balmenach, Linkwood) and Lowland grains (Girvan and Cameronbridge). The majority of the spirit comes from first-fill bourbon barrels, with a few Palo Cortado seasoned butts and refill puncheons. The composition aims to evoke a pastry / baking theme."

      "summary": "In September 2024 Bowmore unveiled a new range of travel retail exclusives. It is called the Bowmore Appellations Collection, referring to the fact that the whiskies are finished in wine casks from different regions: Burgundy, Bordeaux and the Douro valley.In the early 2000s, when many distilleries were experimenting with wine finishes, Bowmore had a small wine-oriented series (Dusk / Dawn / Darkest). I remember buying a 3x 20cl kit as a new whisky enthusiast, and not liking any of them. Later editions were also not convincing. In fact few Bowmore expressions could win me over back then, with perfumy lavender notes ruining the ones that weren't overtaken by wine.Today my top choice would probably be the 22 Year Old finished in Sauternes casks, but at this point I'm trying the Bowmore 19 Year Old finished in Pinot Noir barriques from Burgundy. The travel range comes with a new packaging and bottle, which will be extended accross the core range in 2025."

      "summary": "What do we have here? A blended malt, but we already know that's often just a way of obfuscating the actual (single) distillery. In this case it says LG, which reminds us of a famous Islay distillery.Surprisingly it also says Origin: Europe on the label so legally it's not even a Scotch whisky. That's because it came to mainland Europe after three years of maturation, where The Whisky Jury poured it into a fresh Oloroso sherry cask which they sourced directly from Jerez. It then aged for two more years in Belgium, which makes lose the right to be named Scotch whisky."

Kavalan has some excellent sherry cask suppliers and they know how to recreate their trademark style year after year. On the other hand I notice a bit of fatigue: since I tried my first Solist sherry back in 2013, they are often so similar that I'm less inclined to track them down, assuming there will be no real discoveries any more.

      "summary": "After the Benromach unpeated earlier in 2024, here's one that was released early January 2025. It puts the spotlight on unpeated high enzyme barley.This type of barley typically serves grain whisky production or industrial brewing. Specific processing leads to a higher concentration of enzymes, mainly amylases which break down starch into sugars.Maturation took place exclusively in first fill bourbon casks. This bothers me about the Contrasts range sometimes. It's supposed to be an experiment with one uncommon element, but then they also change other characteristics. This whisky takes out the usual peat smoke and the usual sherry influence as well, making it harder to pinpoint the specific effect of the enzymes."

Show Notes: The impact of recent tariffs and cost implications on consumers. Bourbon market insights: why premium brands continue to thrive even as some larger brands see declines.

      "summary": "The Unchill-filtered range from Signatory Vintage is an entry-level selection. While a bottling strength of 46% used to be a nice selling proposition back in the early 2000s (in fact, the first releases were still 43% while most official bottlings were 40%), it is nowadays perhaps less impressive. It has become more of an affordable range with unchill-filtration as a fairly lightweight selling proposition, nowadays offered by virtually all independent bottlers.We try two whiskies bottled a while ago: Knockando from dechar-rechar hogsheads and Glenlossie from first-fill bourbon casks. As often these are not single cask releases but combinations of several sister casks. Knockando 10 yo 2011 (46%, Signatory Vintage 'Un-Chillfiltered' 2022, hogsheads #306232 + 306248) Nose: starts on draff, porridge and iceberg lettuce, really. Light aromas like lemon candy and lime, honey and white grape as well. Then it turns towards a salty, coastal note with a sour and lightly metallic edge. Butter biscuits in the distance. Simple but certainly not boring.Mouth: still this funny green note that's not quite grassy but more of an earthy vegetable note. Slightly dirty, with herbal and bitter touches too. Then green malt, plenty of freshly cut apples and loads of ale. Walnuts and linden tea, as well as some white pepper.Finish: medium length, with pepper, citrus peels and more bitter herbs.It kinda convinced me on the nose, even though it's not a classic dram, but on the palate it becomes too rough and rude. There, we've had our Knockando for this year. Now I understand it was available for less than € 40, which means we're probably not part of the intended audience. Glenlossie 13 yo 2009 (46%, Signatory Vintage 'Un-Chillfiltered' 2022, first fill bourbon barrels #3392 + 3396 + 3400) Nose: fresh wood shavings at first, like a dusty Ikea drawer. Moves towards grassy notes and dried herbs (oregano and lavas?). Then green apples, lemon candy and floral notes. Later it becomes slightly creamier with a hint of vanilla.Mouth: again a little plankish, leaving a bittersweet impression with lime and lemon peelings, green tea, hints of ginger, vanilla and yellow fruits. Quite green and immature. A lightly perfumed edge too.Finish: medium, slightly harsh and woody again, with white pepper and hints of bitter herbs.Okay, still not convincing. Signatory is releasing delicious stuff in the upper regions, but it's clear that corners are cut in the cheaper stuff. A down to earth session (which is obligatory, once in a while). Score: 74/100"

It comes from the Daniel Lawrence distillery in Medford, the longest surviving distillery of the region, until it closed down in 1905. It appears that M.E. Bellows & Son was their agent in New York at the time. It was probably bottled in the 1880s or 1890s, I've seen a very similar bottle of Scotch whisky from the same importer bottled in 1890.The Daniel Lawrence Distillery was known for its style of New England rum. This lovel American rum was generally considered to be cheap and inferior to imported West Indies rum. However Medford rum was marketed as “the best rum in the States” ."

      "summary": "At this point, there's no escaping it so it's time to embrace it. Atificial intelligence is sweeping across every industry and bourbon is no different. For that reason I've invited Lynette Green on the show. She is the e-commerce manager for Jack Daniel's at Brown-Forman, and we explore the dynamic intersection of technology and the whiskey industry.

Lynette shares her impressive journey with Brown-Forman, highlighting the shifts in digital marketing from its early days to the now crucial role of e-commerce in spirits. The conversation also dives into the potential of AI tools in marketing while balancing them with human creativity, and Lynette's forward-looking vision gives us an insight into the futrue of the direct-to-consumer model. Show Notes: Kenny's tech background and how it shaped his perspective on AI Lynette’s career path within Brown-Forman and her entry into the spirits industry How digital marketing has transformed over the years The role of e-commerce and its industry-specific nuances in the spirits market The importance of creating a compelling digital shelf and effective product pages Strategies for using AI in marketing while maintaining authenticity Future trends in DTC channels for premium spirits Insights into regulatory landscapes affecting the spirits industry The transformative potential of AI in shaping brand narratives and customer experience Support this podcast on Patreon Learn more about your ad choices.

      "summary": "DeinWhisky.de released quite a lot of shop exclusives in 2024. We investigate three releases from different bottlers: Bowmore 2013 (Douglas Laing), Ledaig 2008 (Malts of Scotland) and heavily peated Moine 2012 (The Whisky Jury). Bowmore 10 yo 2013 (58,4%, Douglas Laing Old Particular for DeinWhisky.de 2024, refill barrel ref. 18397, 240 btl.) Nose: initially a smoky note that is louder than expected, with an underpinning of coffee and brown sugar. Mineral ashes, green pepper and newspaper ink. Then it develops fruity notes, like peach and tangerine. Light salty touches and a hint of butter biscuits as well.Mouth: oily, salty and peaty again, with layers of mango and grilled pineapple underneath. Yellow apple and creamy guava. Firmly maritime, with a minty edge, which works well alongside the lightly tropical fruits. Some pepper and salt, as well as a mild woody note (aniseed).Finish: long and markedly salty. Still a faint hint of coffee beans, with oak and smoky notes.A very good young Bowmore. The typical fruitiness of the old expressions is already present, but it is still coupled to plenty of smoke and oak spice. A clean bourbon cask works wonder for Bowmore. Too late to buy this one, I believe. Ledaig 2008 (56,2%, Malts of Scotland for DeinWhisky.de 2024, PX sherry hogshead, 281 btl.) Nose: balanced warming smoke again, this time with a slightly farmy touch, petrol and hints of car workshops. The mild funk reminds me of some Jamaican rum too. Then a bit of sheep wool, blood orange, pine needles and a hint of tobacco.Mouth: powerful smoke, with a coastal side and well balanced PX fruit. Hints of cassis and cherry candy. More tobacco, sea breeze, candied citrus and a hint of honey. Then the metallic Ledaig touch comes out. Light cocoa, brine and mild antiseptics too.Finish: long, slightly more angular. Hints of burnt rubber and bacon, with bittersweet herbs.Another good choice. Interesting funk on the nose and a very civilised PX cask. Right, also sold out. Score: 88/100 Bunnahabhain Moine 2012 (56,8%, The Whisky Jury for DeinWhisky.de 2024, first-fill Oloroso cask #09003, 340 btl.) Nose: instant pleasure. Lots of cigar boxes with dark chocolate notes and lovely hints of old, dusty drawers. Then hints of cecina meat from Spain, charcoal, dried herbs and mint, lots of pipe tobacco and some raisins. It's a dry style of peat with a dry style of sherry, which works really well. Just a few red berries. In fact it reminds me of a few (rare) heavily sherried Port Ellens that we had in the era of Pe1.Mouth: really good again. Warm campfire smoke (more towards Lagavulin now), with walnuts, herbs and a subtle salty edge. Slightly more sweetness now, raisins and raspberry jam. Some oily / maritime notes too, alongside Cola sweets, tobacco leaves and earthy hints. Just a little coffee in the end.Finish: long, warm and smoky, with black peppercorns, dark caramel and a sweet-sour-salt combination.Overall a fairly wild Moine, with deep savoury smoke coupled to a few salty and pickled notes. A lovely warm Islay character. With a couple of years in the bottle it will certainly break the 90 point limit. This one is still available from DeinWhisky.de. Score: 89/100"

      "summary": "If we would express our sentiment towards Edradour like the stock market, then it would show a moderately rising trend. The distillery released a number of weird cask experiments and mediocre core range expressions in the past, but things are improving in my opinion. In recent years independent bottlers picked a couple of nicer examples and now official bottlings seem to behave better as well.Today we're looking at a recent small batch release matured in Madeira casks. Remarkably it was both distilled and bottled on a 29th of February - shouldn't the age have been counted in leap years then?"

      "summary": "We dig into the samples from the Whisky Tour of the World from Gravity Drinks once more. This set contains 24 samples of whiskies from all over the planet. Launched ahead of the festive season, it is now still available online.We'll visit Germany, Austria and Finland, starting with Beverbach Tri-Cask, a single malt whisky from Hardenberg distillery in Germany. They produce it with the classic pot still / double distillation method and mature it in Kentucky bourbon casks, new American oak and German Napoleon oak barrels. I believe this refers to the age of the Annweiler forest where the oak was grown. Beverbach Tri-Cask (43%, OB 2024) Nose: light with a pronounced sourness. Green apples, lemons, unripe pears, merely on the same level as the youngish layer of cereals. Then some grassy / minty notes, white pepper and a hint of grappa or vodka. Earthy oak shavings in the background, reasonably dosed.Mouth: quite a sharp onset, slightly alcoholic. There's still a firm sourness (unripe peach, citrus and pear) which moves towards ginger with metallic overtones. Then some mild vanilla and light honey sweetness from the wood. More raw cereals now (porridge, whit bread), along with pepper and just a hint of marmalade.Finish: on the short side, with more cereals, mint and a light nuttiness.This seems to get good reviews (mostly from magazines in their home country, I must add...) but to me it doesn't stand out from the abundant newish distilleries. It's light, without any important shortcomings, but it remains a very young and neutral (boring) spirit. Also the Napoleon oak is probably just a gimmick. Now we move to Austria. Distillery Krauss produces Sulm Valley Whiskey, a bourbon-style whiskey (hence the 'e') made mostly from an ancient corn variety that is grown especially for them in Sulm Valley. The spirit matures in new toasted American oak casks. Although the distillery website mentions an ABV of 48%, my sample states 46% ABV.In 2022 they won the award for Best World Whisky at the Las Vegas Global Spirits Awards. An award which was then often falsely mentioned as Best Whisky in the World, which is obviously not the same... Krauss Sulm Valley Whiskey (46%, OB +/- 2024) Nose: a rather typical mix of dry oak shavings (Ikea pack style) with mashed banana and mildly sweet corn. Then hints of new leather satchel bags, with growing layers of orange and vanilla.Mouth: a lot of sweet corn now, with honey and vanilla. The back to mashed bananas (and banana ice cream) while oak spice grows stronger. Aniseed, white pepper. The woody component is quite loud though.Finish: medium length, mostly on wood elements, with firm pepper and nutmeg. Faint hints of roasted coffee beans too.An interesting Austrian take on American whiskey. It's not as sweet as I expected, which is good, but then it also adopts the blatant woodiness of its American exmple. Not entirely necessary, but not bad either. Score: 75/100 Last one for today: the Rye Malt from The Helsinki Distilling Co. The distillery started in 2014 as the first distillery in the city in over 100 years.Their Rye Malt expression is an excercise to balance the smoothness of barley and the spiciness of rye. It is bottled in numbered releases, always a small batch of a handful of casks, aged around 3-4 years, but always different. This being a sample specifically produced for Gravity Drinks, I'm not sure whether it equals one of the batches that is available in large bottles. Helsinki Whiskey - Rye Malt (47,5%, OB 2024) Nose: scorched plywood and fresh oak shavings. A new sauna? Then plenty of rye bread. Underneath there are some aniseed, caraway seeds, hints of apples and sour berries. Also green bell peppers, a faint floral edge and a light whiff of vanilla.Mouth: sweeter than expected. Toffee notes and candy sugar, with yellow apples. Also a lightly synthetic sweetness, like the glue of a post stamp (well, the ones that you needed to lick yourself). Light biscuits. Then back to anise, juniper. More malty than the nose, but overall still a little too woody and rough.Finish: medium, quite green and mildly bitter now, with grassy notes, young wood and some rye spice.I find these hybrids hard to score. I like some of its aspects, but down the road it doesn't really come together yet. A different mindset is required if you're approaching it from a malt perspective, and maybe more time is needed, with less active wood. A different rum cask version is available from The Whisky Exchange. Score: 78/100"

      "summary": "Today is all about Château Hontambère. This domain is in the Ténarèze region and owns about 42 hectares of vineyards. It is a relatively young winery (first production in 2008) but they have a significant production of around 60-80 barrels per year.They have four grape varieties: Colombard since the beginning and later also Ugni Blanc, Baco and Folle Blanche. Sales are focused on the US but they're now starting to become known in Europe as well, with a wider range than before. For more background information, check their website.Hontambère is offering its own production, but they also have a Rare Armagnac Collection, a series of old armagnacs acquired from other producers, some of which now closed.One thing I'm not very fond of is the fact that the original producer is often hidden entirely on armagnac bottlings. The Grape of the Art 1985 was acquired from the lost Pouchégu for instance, but it only says Hontambère on the label. The same goes for the 1982 we're having today. Not only a problem with Hontambère by the way, armagnac is just not whisky in that sense. If you're wearing two hats (producer + bottler / négociant) things should be more transparent, in my opinion. Armagnac Hontambère 2013 Folle Blanche (49,8%, OB +/- 2024, cask #A24) Nose: close to the wine, I'd say, with hints of grapes and mirabelles as well as a lemony acidity. A bright spicy note too: soft pepper, as well as some aniseed and minty freshness. Then a subtle nuttiness appears, mostly on almond and caramelized peanuts.Mouth: fairly sweet and fruity, with a creamy texture and a nice balance. Hints of eau-de-vie of plums, with a peppery and almost gingery kick. Nougat, hints of toffee, hazelnut and faint vanilla. Then subtle herbal notes, even a salty touch. Overall a bit spirity around the edges though.Finish: medium length, on mild oak spice.Fairly youngish, not yet in the territory that most independent bottlers are exploring. A very refined spirit but not very complex. It's missing one key asset: time. Armagnac Hontambère 2011 Baco (57,2%, OB +/- 2024, cask #TC9) Nose: a step up in terms of richness and aromatic intensity. Plenty of apricots, with orange notes, stewed grapes and hints of quince jam. There's a volatile nice layer of varnish and floral oak too. Then dark honey and whiffs of vanilla pastry, as well as a mild peppery touch.Mouth: quite round and viscous, with some of the fruits making a return. Jammy apricots and quince paste, with a few drops of Triple Sec. Then more honey, hints of marzipan and caramelized hazelnuts. A bit more spiciness towards the end, mainly pepper as well as a gin-like herbal edge.Finish: quite long, with lingering fruity notes and a spicy finale.Not much older in fact, but more to my liking. The elegant varnished nose is really good and it finds a nice balance between youthful power and elegance. Score: 87/100 Armagnac Pouchégu 41 yo 1982 Ugni Blanc (52,7%, Hontambère 'Rare Collection' +/- 2024, cask #F2) Nose: now we're talking! This beautiful varnished note again, but also plenty of juicy fruits. Cherries even (Maraschino but also sour cherry jam) which I don't find often in armagnac. Also apricot jam, red plums, raisins and raspberries. Dried flowers. Hints of cigar boxes, along with sandalwood or thuja, vanilla beans, candied pecans and light minty notes. Subtle hints of tobacco as well, reminding me of an old Oloroso. Excellent.Mouth: it starts with similar tart cherries, plums and juicy raisins, but the fruitiness becomes quite tropical after a while. Think pink grapefruit, maybe mango. Then it develops more spices, like nutmeg, cinnamon and liquorice wood. Some tannin bitterness, sure (but less than I expected), mainly sandalwood.Finish: very long, with tobacco and hints of leather, with more of these juicy fruits all along.I think the cherry theme here is spectacular. On the palate it is clearly more wood-influenced, but it blends exotic wood with tropical fruity hints in a very complex and concentrated ensemble. Succulent armagnac - hard to believe this is sold at under € 200. Score: 92/100"

      "summary": "Belgian distillery Filliers recently started the sixth chapter in their history, with Benoit Filliers as the next generation in the company management. He's clearly looking at things with an open mind, showing a lot of enthusiasm. Recently the distillery launched two new expressions: Filliers 15 Year Old and the Cask Strength expression which we're having today. The 15 Years sticks to the recipe of the cornerstone 10 Year Old, but the cask strength version is slightly different because it replaces Oloroso with Pedro Ximénez sherry casks.While Filliers installed two copper pot stills from Forsyths in 2018, the whisky on the market today still comes from their copper alembics, also used for their other core product: traditional genever. Even though it's a double distilled single malt, these alembics give the spirit a character that is different from Scotch.Filliers has been investing heavily in sherry casks, with a very rigid acquisition policy. They're all bought from one supplier, they're all first-fill European oak and they're almost exclusively Oloroso. Their warehouse houses the oldest sherry matured Belgian whisky, but due to the cask management it's one very specific style of sherry, with less variety than most Scottish distilleries can offer. This PX version is a nice exception to this rule.The bottle comes in a unique, elaborate packaging. It uses snap fasteners to attach the lid to the bottom, which also doubles as a nice display stand. The bottle itself has a great premium feel as well, world class really."

They have several distilleries and several brands, with Haryana focusing on producing single malt only. Check th Indri website for more background information.Now they have two very similar versions of their single malt: there's Trini - The Three Wood and then there's another version which says Indri Triple Cask. My miniature bottle says Triple Cask - it was part of the Whisky Tour of the World from Gravity Drinks. From what I can find, this is technically a travel retail expression, but cask types and other elements appear to be the same as Trini. In both cases they're using local barley and three types of casks: bourbon, PX sherry and French wine casks, bottled at the same strength."

      "summary": "Decadent Drinks just released these two bottlings: Westport 2003 (technically a blended malt, but obviously a teaspooned malt from the giraffe distillery, you know) with a sherry finish, and Mortlach 2005 from a fresh bourbon barrel. We're in the Decadent Drams series here. Westport 21 yo 2003 (51,8%, Decadent Drinks 2024, refill hogshead + first fill American oak Oloroso hogshead finish, 217 btl.) Nose: very aromatic, with a lot of fruit cake, soaked raisins, peaches in syrup and plenty of (blood) oranges. Vanilla sugar and honey. Then also figs, marmalade and a nice hint of furniture polish. This also brings a hint of fresh oak shavings, some pipe tobacco and something lightly perfumed - maybe vetiver? Attractive.Mouth: more of these aromatic notes. Syrupy fruits, lots of sultanas, fresh plum and orange. Then it evolves to lemon balm, a mild herbal side and the typical acidity and rancio note of an old cognac. Honey, but also a feeling of potpourri. Tobacco leaves, marzipan, drops of orange blossom water, more marmalade and fruit teas.Finish: quite long, with more fruit tea, raisins, marmalade and a resinous / leafy layer.This has a peculiar woodiness to it, resinous and fragrant, which makes it a little spin-doctored. Very entertaining whisky. Available from Decadent Drinks direct, or Royal Mile Whiskies for instance. Mortlach 19 yo 2005 (52%, Decadent Drinks 2024, first fill bourbon barrel, 181 btl.) Nose: big, fat Mortlach. There's a hint of Williams pears, a little chalk and wax, fresh putty and litres of sunflower oil. A hint of mirabelle eau-de-vie, dandelions. Then bready notes, a little green banana, wee minty notes. Lots of tiny elements, it keeps developing for a very long time.Mouth: more fattiness, plenty of sweet chalk, paraffin, subtle hints of bitter oranges. Still a hint of eau-de-vie, in a nice way. Lighter honey, sweet herbs, gorse flower, apple and lemon peels. Minerals and grapefruits.Finish: long, always this sweetened sunflower oil note. Chalk, light pepper and cereal notes.Love this fatty character. A great tension between austere and rich elements. I've always had a \"yes, but...\" opinion about Mortlach, but this is very good and pretty unique for a Speysider. Check Decadent Drinks or Royal Mile Whiskies again. Score: 89/100"

It has only featured once on this website, as far as I can remember: Box Quercus Robur.Founded in 2010, the distillery changed its name to High Coast in 2018, after a brand collision with Compass Box. It is located 450 km north from Stockholm, exactly at 63° north latitude, where they have winters down to -38°C. Their core range is called The Origins and consists of four expressions, which we'll investigate today. I discovered it through DeinWhisky, who are selling a box with miniature bottles of all four.High Coast Älv is their lightest offering (both colour and ABV). It simply translates to ‘river’ in Swedish, referring to the Ångermanälven river the distillery sits on."

The episode features a pre-recorded interview with Congressman Morgan McGarvey, wherein he shares insights on the political landscape of bourbon tariffs and their wider economic consequences. The discussion highlights bourbon's historical role in trade negotiations and the precarious situation for the industry, especially for smaller distilleries that may struggle to adapt. The short end of this is that consumers and producers alike need to come together in support of bourbon's vibrant culture. Show Notes: Congressman Morgan McGarvey's insights on tariffs affecting bourbon. Historical context of U.S.-Canada trade relations and its influence on bourbon sales. Discussion on the differing impacts of tariffs on large brands vs. craft distilleries. A call for unity and support within the bourbon community facing these challenges.

They claim to use spirit of up to 12 years, matured in ex-bourbon American Oak casks, ex-sherry casks and Japanese Mizunara oak casks. I'm not sure whether this is made with Scotch whiskies or Japanese components."

In this epsiode, we sit down with the Bourbon Junkies—Sean Paisley and Dan Shook—to explore their remarkable journey from casual bourbon enthusiasts to influential content creators and entrepreneurs. These guys started out as childhood friends and just couldn't leave each other's side. After ditching power lifting they decided to get into the whiskey space and as they put it, their initial lack of experience led to hilariously authentic early videos. We then take spin into their new whiskey brand, Evernorth. They discuss their dissatisfaction with market pricing and their vision for producing whiskeys that resonate with their community, highlighting the challenges and experiences that come with navigating the whiskey market. Show Notes: Origins of the Bourbon Junkies YouTube channel Transitioning from powerlifting talks to whiskey content The impact of consistency and community on brand growth Humorous trials from their initial video-making experiences The significance of live streaming and viewer engagement Launching Evernorth: motivations and long-term vision Challenges in sourcing and distilling whiskey today Insights on consumer pricing and market transparency Future aspirations for Evernorth in quality and volume Support this podcast on Patreon Learn more about your ad choices.

One of them is this Cragganmore 1986 from the now completed Whisky Sponge series.This underwent an intruiging maturation scheme. It started in a refill hogshead (for 30 years), then a first-fill Port barrique (5 years) and then back to a second-fill bourbon barrel. According to the Sponge, the profile should be more akin to that of a long maturation in refill sherrywood."

Especially their Benriach 1976 cask #3029 gave them a lot of fame, even here in Europe.The latest (sixth) Japonism release is this Antique Blended Scotch 1976. While the label officially says Blended Scotch (in fact, it says Blended Scocth...), it is likely to be a teaspooned Highland malt."

I remember years ago when Pursuit Spirits was very young making some phone calls looking for particular barrels. One of the calls I made was to Richard Wolf. As a general consumer, you have no idea who he is but Richard was at the forefront of the consulting and barrel broker game for decades. Years later, I got to meet his daughter Monica who is putting her own stamp on the whiskey world behind many NDP brands you see on the shelf today. Monica is one of those people that likes to stick behind the scenes and politely turned down my requests to come on the show. However, when I heard about the passing of her dad, I let the dust settle and came to her with the idea that she should come on the show and talk about her dad's legacy and all the influence he had on the industry that not many people knew about. I'm glad she did because this is one of those rare times we get to reflect on days past.

A cryptic message that accompanied the sample indicates it contains Bunnahabhain, Glenlivet, Highland Park, Macallan and Glenrothes, along with Invergordon and North British. I expect this to come from the same batch of casks that gave us the Maiden's Blend releases."

Today we'll top this with a 34 year old bottled by Elixir Distillers in the Director's Special series. I also dug up a sparring partner, a 30 year old version from the same series.Around ten years ago Imperial, even though it was a closed distillery, was fairly common among independent bottlers. Always a joy to try this deeply fruity spirit, often slightly tropical and nicely waxy."

      "summary": "We've already had nice sessions of Thy Whisky. First a series of 7 releases and then a review of the 2024 core range. Overall they tend to impress despite their young age, making it one of my favourites among the young European distilleries.We start with two of their Heritage expressions: the Imperial Heritage Barley 2019 and the Heritage Wheat cask #376. Thy Heritage Barley - Imperial Vintage 2019 5 yo (56%, OB 2024, 7 Oloroso casks + 1 bourbon cask, 931 btl.) Nose: very malty, showing breads and raw cereal husks, along with dried grassy notes. Then a pleasant sweetness of pear and red berries, along with orange peels and a hint of vanilla cake. The sherry cask brings lots of caramel aromas to the table. Simple but pleasant.Mouth: richer now, showing plenty of depth and a rich, oily texture. It goes from apple sweetness and butter biscuits all the way to (heavy) peppery spice. In the middle there are lemons, a lot of grainy notes (almost rye whisky), plenty of aniseed and a few drops of herbal bitters. More hay and caramelized notes, as well as drying leafy notes.Finish: medium, with more of this toffee / grain combo, citrus and nuts.I prefer bourbon casks in a first encounter with a new barley type, but the end result is really nice. A great texture and a balanced sherry influence are the main assets. Sold out. The next expressions revolves around heritage wheat. There's malted emmer and spelt, unmalted øland wheat, malted rye and a bit of malted barley. This ensemble matured together in a single 120-liter virgin oak cask. Thy Heritage Wheat 2020 (50%, OB 2024, first fill new oak quarter cask #376, 78 btl.) Nose: less balanced, in the sense that the virgin oak takes the upper hand - a feeling that is highlighted by the spiciness of the grains. Nutmeg, black peppercorns and hints of ground coffee beans. Pencil shavings. Then fresh rye bread appears, with gentle leafy touches and scorched herbs. Hardly any fruits.Mouth: even more American rye style now. Spicy notes, like pepper and peppermint, nutmeg and cinnamon, with caramelized nuts underneath. Gentle bittersweet notes and liquorice roots. Dark hints of coffee, as well as pine wood and ashy cedar.Finish: quite long, with more bittersweet notes, leafy hints, liquorice and wood spice.A whole lot darker than the barley version, and coming close to some American whiskeys at times. I think the wood spice and bitterness is a little too loud here, but it's an interesting dram. Score: 80/100 The next one is Hawboen, the 23rd limited edition (in fact, it is the penultimate release in the 24-part inaugural series which took 10 years to complete). It consists of pale malt and beechwood smoked malt. It is their first purely bourbon cask aged whisky since 2016. Thy Whisky No. 23 - Hawboen (51,5%, OB 2023, bourbon casks, 1320 btl.) Nose: this feels like a reset. Very clean cereals, with hints of aniseed and juniper, as well as some resinonus notes and fresh pine needles. The restrained wood highlights the fruity notes, such as apples and plenty of citrus, with light honey and a mild hint of coconut and vanilla. Then a faint hint of beechwood smoke as well.Mouth: sweet yellow apples with light honey, hints of sweetened herbal tea and a subtle undertone of wood smoke. Butter biscuits with salt flakes. Then more pine, mint, juniper and a very light bitter edge. Roasted coconut. Gets quite mineral in the end.Finish: medium, on roasted herbs, citrus notes, honey and soft smoke.Nice to see a pure bourbon expression again. Moreover I think the beechwood smoked malt is also a very typical element in the Thy profile. It may get a tad bitter here and there, but I think it's a beautiful young composition. Available from the distillery website, but this one can also be bought from The Whisky Exchange. Score: 86/100 The last one is a similar mix of pale malt and beechwood smoked malt. It comes from PX and Oloroso casks this time.The distillery explains that some sherry casks in their warehouse stand out with extra deep sweetness and old, earthy, and complex notes from many years of aging sherry wines in southern Spain. For this release they selected seven intense PX sherry casks and three extra fruity and vinous oloroso casks.I'm quite leery when it comes to sherry casks, and when I see the name Tonelería del Sur (in Montilla) and sizes from 64 liter over 120 liter to 500 liter, I wonder whether these were seasoned with proper sherry wine. Thy Whisky PX & Oloroso (49,5%, OB 2024, 1268 btl.) Nose: brown sugar, figs and plums, with a good dose of sweet malty notes and tobacco. Then milk chocolate, caramelized almonds, nougat. Whiffs of cinnamon pastry. Some lightly earthy herbs, as well as more heady notes of mint and faint citrus. Mouth: quite thick and oily, with a caramelized layer and some roasted notes. The warming beechwood smoke starts light but picks up weight along the way, always keeping its typical herbal edge. Dried fruit and butterscotch underneath.Finish: medium length, slightly drier, with cigar boxes, liquorice and caramelized nuts.Here as well, the beechwood smoked malt works nicely with Oloroso and PX. As soon as the inaugural series is complete, this should become a regular release, in my opinion. Score: 87/100"

      "summary": "For the 2024 Campbeltown Malts Festival, Glen Scotia distillery released this limited edition. The whisky matured in first-fill bourbon barrels and then went into Fino sherry casks for six months. Glen Scotia 9 yo (56,2%, OB for Campbeltown Malts Festival 2024, first-fill bourbon + Fino sherry finish) Nose: quite rounded, with vanilla, lemon, apricots and peaches, as well as almonds. A second wave brings mineral oils, golden raisins and light spearmint. Subtle coastal notes as well, though minimal, with faint yeasty notes, green leaves and hints of pickle juice.Mouth: still some sweet fruitiness, now also showing a clearer Fino character. Think seaweed, plain sea salt, leafy notes and a hint of chamomile. Then powerful white pepper, a light vinegary sour note and some woody astringency. Hints of sulphur in the background. Increasingly salty towards the end.Finish: quite long, still salty, with floral overtones, ginger, herbs and a slightly industrial metallic note.This does show the funky Glen Scotia notes, and it does also show a firm Fino character. That said, there's also a fruitiness from the bourbon wood that doesn't fit in entirely. Overall it leaves me scratching my head. People tend to be slightly forgiving at a festival, but I don't think I would buy this now."

      "summary": "After the launch of the Whiskyland series (August 2024) there is a steady stream of really good bottlings from Decadent Drinks. Today we're trying the latest chapters five, seven and eight. Most of them seem to be sister casks of previous Whisky Sponge releases.I don't think I've received a sample of chapter six, but that could be a deliberate choice - I'm generally not the biggest fan of perfumed and flowery Bowmore from the 1980s. No urge to confirm this, thank you. Tomatin 30 yo 1994 (51,6%, Decadent Drinks 'Whiskyland' 2024, refill hogshead, 230 btl.) Nose: bright yellow fruits, with honey. Red apples, pears, guava and pineapples, as well as honeysuckle. Grapes and gooseberries, going back and forth between greener and more tropical fruits. Light chalky notes, hints of wisteria. Then a hint of vanilla in the distance, along with some scented candles.Mouth: more fruit salad, mixing lime and tangerine with guava, green plums, pears and unripe mirabelles. Then hints of green tea and green bananas. The candles are back, leaving a waxy footprint, along with some citrus oils. Very nice honeyed notes, as well as a light oaky touch in the end.Finish: quite long, with more sweet plums, crystallized ginger and waxy oak.A rather Irish style of Tomatin, centered around fruits of different colours and continents. Very nice fruit salad. Probably a sister cask of the Whisky Sponge Tomatin 1994, but this one seems slightly wider. Available from Decadent Drinks or retailers such as The Whisky Exchange. Springbank 30 yo 1994 (48,8%, Decadent Drinks 'Whiskyland' 2024, refill sherry hogshead, 247 btl.) Nose: very elegant, with lots of berries hint of polished brassware and old Oloroso notes. It's actually quite juicy, with hints of cognac, orange cake and drops of old Rivesaltes. Some mineral and waxy elements too, along with some furniture polish and sweet mint. Not much of the typical Springbank funk, except for a subtle earthy hint and tobacco in the background.Mouth: still elegant, but now more pronouncedly Springbank. More berry juice, bright honey, along with walnut cake and savoury hints of herbs. Then the coastal side comes forward, together with soft peat and a hint of camphor. Old Oloroso runs throughout it. Beautiful musty notes underneath, as well as leather and cocoa nibs in the end.Finish: medium to long, with more tobacco and waxy notes, nutty sherry and lingering fruits.There are funky Springbank versions from sherry casks (like this Westie Sponge 1999), but this is an equally beautiful style, incredibly balanced and harmonious. It reminds me of its Whisky Sponge sister, but it's rounder, fruitier and frankly better. A highlight of 2025, so soon in January? Sold out, as far as I can tell. Score: 93/100 Caol Ila 32 yo 1992 (51,8%, Decadent Drinks 'Whiskyland' 2024, refill hogshead, 210 btl.) Nose: instant maritime notes. Iodine, wet rocks, brine and green pepper. Refined peat smoke (wood ash), as well as rubbed lemon skins and sea salt. Then some greener notes, like fresh grass and pine needles. Menthol and mineral oils too.Mouth: the kind of mineral sharpness that reminds us of late 1970s Port Ellen, perfectly matched to a lightly sweet, waxy note. Oyster juice, fisherman's rope, herbal tea and plenty of brine. Then back to an almost syrupy and oily layer of citrus, yellow apple and squid ink, as well as light caramel. A gentle peatiness with an underlying peppery note.Finish: long, peppery, still showing this sweet layer along with green tea and earthy smoke.A very elegant and refined Caol Ila, much like the early 1980s releases that we saw ten years ago, though perhaps slightly richer. Mineral and coastal, but showing an above average sweetness too. Excellent. Available from Decadent Drinks, or The Whisky Exchange, or Royal Mile Whiskies for instance. Score: 91/100"

      "summary": "In the 1960s, 70s and 80s, Italy used to be fond of young single malts. The cornerstone was the Glen Grant 5 Year Old introduced by Giovinetti in the 1960s. Other importers followed his idea, like Soffiantino with Glenburgie.Mostly known for being a key component of Ballantine's, Glenburgie has few official bottlings. Like the young Glenlivets and Glen Grants of that era, some of the early Glenburgies mention a vintage on the label, but by the 1980s this seems to have been omitted. Glenburgie-Glenlivet 5 yo '100% malt whisky' (40%, OB for Soffiantino 1980s) Nose: a slightly thin nose with nice hints of linseed oil, old metals and hints of ginger. Apple peelings and plenty of grassy notes. A slightly dusty, papery note as well. Then mild pepper, aniseed and hints of cardamom come out. Vague hints of coal and pastry cream in the background.Mouth: clean, neutral spirit with vague apples, liquorice and mild herbal notes. A hint of apple pith. Then a very light caramelly touch and some marzipan sweetness. More metal polish appears, which could be part of the old bottle effect. White pepper and hints of roasted nuts in the end.Finish: medium, with grainy notes, grassy touches and a lightly bitter herbal note.Regardless of the distillery, these 5 year olds for Italy were ubiquitous malts, fairly unpretentious but really not bad either. To modern standards they feel a little light and spirity, but with some OBE they are often really enjoyable. Auction material."

      "summary": "Caol Ila is always a welcome subject, especially for a head-to-head comparison. It's easy to find similar expressions from different bottlers. Today we're looking at Caol Ila 2007, 2010 and 2011 single casks from Maltbarn, Whisky AGE and Elixir Distillers. Caol Ila 17 yo 2007 (54,2%, Maltbarn 2024, sherry cask, 171 btl.) Nose: very nice, showing a lot of ashy bonfire character, along with a sour sherry note, walnuts and hints of sharp apple. Then coastal notes like seashells, wet sand and sea air. Hints of leather and linseed oil too.Mouth: quite a robust smokiness again, slightly warmer (South coast Islay) than you'd expect from Caol Ila. Tarry notes, boat rope and burnt herbs. Then mid-palate it shows a great citrusy freshness, along with orange sweetness, hints of tobacco leaves, medicinal bitters and mild honey. Hints of liquorice and espresso as well.Finish: long, tarry and ashy, along with salted liquorice, burnt bacon and tarry ropes.A nice style, the sherry cask made this less crystalline than I expected. Very good though, with some additional richness and a warming layer of peat smoke. Still available from the Whiskybase shop for instance. Caol Ila 13 yo 2010 (55,4%, Whisky AGE 2023, refill barrel #319312, 220 btl.) Nose: the brighter and fruitier style. Rubbed lemon skins and limes, along with candied ginger, dried apple and clean smoke. Some wool, linseed oil and a hint of vanilla. Then brine, ashes and sea spray.Mouth: very clean and fresh again. Citrus fruits with bonfire smoke and hints of sweet bacon. Candied ginger and vanilla again, along with a hint of cashew nuts and cardamom.Finish: quite long, with warmer hints of peat smoke. Still quite rounded though, mostly on citrus fruits and vanilla.A rather easy style of Caol Ila, with the second-fill bourbon cask adding roundness. Cleaner and less complex than the sherry cask before, but roughly on the same level. Score: 87/100 Caol Ila 12 yo 2011 (61,2%, Elixir Distillers 'Single Malts of Scotland' 2023, sherry butt #301634, 600 btl.) Nose: slightly more sherried again, although it's still cleaner than the Maltbarn version. Hints of roasted vegetables with a slightly rubbery edge, along with beach pebbles and salty smoke. Then some burnt heather and bacon, charcoal, hay and sweet hints of glazed donuts.Mouth: sharp peat, with plenty of saline notes and smouldering Mediterranean herbs. Hints of Maggi, ashes, kippers, damp hay and a little chilli. Some alcohol burn, but it takes water well. Scorched lemon peels and grilled shellfish.Finish: long, more umami than the others, with herbal smoke and a saline finale.An ashy Coal Ila with plenty of intensity. There's also an umami edge that seems to stain the pristine character a little. Score: 86/100"

      "summary": "The WhiskyNerds are back - their latest release was a Secret Islay back in 2023, right? They've now selected a 30 year old brandy from France.The fact that this spirit was bottled in the UK makes it a French Brandy instead of a cognac. This is is often called early landed, referring to Hine cognac, which was the only brand that got an exception to the requirement to bottle all cognac within its origin. Grande Champagne tells us enough though. We've seen similar 1993 releases from the Thompson Brothers and The Whisky Agency for instance."

      "summary": "Here are the two remaining whiskies from the Dalswinton series that we hadn't reviewed before. Check the Claxton's website for more backgound information on this series. Today we're looking at the Clynelish 1993 and Bowmore 1992. Clynelish 30 yo 1993 (44,5%, Claxton's 'Dalswinton series' 2024, bourbon barrel) Nose: pretty great, with a chalky and waxy start. Damp clay, with hints of bread dough and wet cellar. Then some dried herbs, ripe yellow (cider) apples, honeydew melon. Glorious hints of wax candles and dandelions. Subtle whiffs of honey, vanilla pods and lemon candy. There's something of an 'antique blend' note as well.Mouth: definitely Clynelish. Still markedly waxy (or buttery), although the sweetness makes it rounder. Pears and melons, as well as some peaches. Orange and grapefruit peels, with some fennel and white pepper. Even a hint of aspirin, leaving a slight bitter footprint. Then subtle tobacco, hay and old wood.Finish: long and slightly dusty, on eucalyptus oil, oak and herbs. Hints of dried grass too.Pure Clynelish, with this lovely waxiness that's so unique. Now on the palate it tends to become a tad austere with some bitterness creeping in. That's where it lost a point. Overall a very good whisky though. Bowmore 30 yo 1992 (43,5%, Claxton's 'Dalswinton series' 2024, Oloroso sherry cask) Nose: ashy and coastal. There's camphor, iodine and eucalyptus, as well as some aniseed. Grassy smoke, with wet gravel and a little leather. Then increasing hints of vanilla, the scent of a pine forest and herbal notes. Roasted pineapple and mango are already around the corner, but doesn't express itself fully.Mouth: now the tropical fruits come out more. Mango, pink grapefruit and sweet pineapple. Very thick and fatty, with waxy notes, vanilla and delicate smoke underneath. Then mildly medicinal notes, oak char, iodine and a floral edge. Not exactly powerful, but other than that this ticks all the boxes.Finish: long, with more tropical tartness, delicate hints of bandages and eucalyptus, as well as a chalky / waxy hint.The Oloroso sherry cask doesn't leave a big footprint, but the tropical notes are always exciting. Very good, despite becoming a tad fragile at times. The Dalswinton series contains a few utterly delicious whiskies and together with the Springbank this Bowmore is one of my favourites. Score: 92/100"

      "summary": "Edrington blending stocks have been around for a couple of years now. They got on my radar in 2016 and they were soon rumoured to be malt bases, pre-destined to become a premium blend at some point but offloaded due to a change of business plans.David Stirk's book Independent Scotch explains well how abandonded ideas of large players often make their way to smaller indie bottlers in large parcels of similar casks. I've once written a Malt Maniacs e-pistle myself about how these parcels are split among several bottlers (or 'labelers' if you like).Anyway, Vintage Bottlers just bottled a small series of four Blended Scotches. These compositions were originally crafted in 1999, using a mix of whiskies from Macallan, Glenturret, Highland Park and North British, laid to rest in first fill sherry butts. Each bottle contains a different bird - one of them is the (famous) Black Grouse, how appropriate. Maiden's Blend 25 yo 1999 (43,8%, Vintage Bottlers 2024, sherry butt #8, 643 btl.) Nose: feels like a blended malt, with a really nice sherry character to it. Mild chocolate and dark nougat, along with brown sugar and cinnamon cookies. There's a hint of toasted hazelnuts and grains in the background, as well as some subtle mint and orange peels. Increasingly leafy over time.Mouth: on the drier side, which is good. There's toffee and vanilla but also light tobacco and hints of black pepper. You do feel the maturity, although the (old) grain whisky is now also easier to note (citrusy, slightly thinner). Then it continues on leather and a very subtle smoky edge.Finish: medium to long, with more oranges, tobacco notes and mild oak spice.A nice one, showing good depth and enough punch despite the modest ABV. Overall a nicey mature blend and a good start of this session. Available from Vintage Bottlers. Maiden's Blend 25 yo 1999 (43,9%, Vintage Bottlers 2024, sherry butt #9, 643 btl.) Nose: slightly thinner and cleaner perhaps - I mean less chocolaty and less sherried. Closer to a true blend, I'd say. We're getting brighter plummy notes along with metallic hints and cigar boxes. Then nutmeg and white pepper, along with some mossy notes.Mouth: more blend-y indeed. Plenty of grainy notes, both barley and hints of grain whisky. This seems closer to, say, Highland Park than to Macallan. Hints of tea, a drop of heather honey and a light hint of this typical vanilla-coconut combo.Finish: medium, clean, with vanilla, light herbs and an almost rum-like hint of honey.In this cask the grain whisky seems to come out more, taking away some of the sherry goodness and depth of its sister. Available from Vintage Bottlers. Score: 85/100 Maiden's Blend 25 yo 1999 (44,6%, Vintage Bottlers 2024, sherry butt #6, 652 btl.) Nose: aromatic heathery notes stand out, along with leafy notes and dried berries. Then demerara sugar, honey and leather, with some more earthy notes in the background. Nutmeg and clove studded orange.Mouth: sweeter than the others, with more oranges and a hint of coconut, as well as golden raisins, cake and gingerbread syrup. Half Highland Park, half grain whisky again, or so it seems. Roasted coffee beans and light coastal elements appear towards the end.Finish: medium to long, still sailing the wave of sweet fruits, coconut, with polished oak and pepper.More Orkney goodness here, with a nice honey character and some coastal notes. Overall more syrupy and less sherried than expected, but really nice on its own. Available from Vintage Bottlers. Score: 86/100 Maiden's Blend 25 yo 1999 (44,6%, Vintage Bottlers 2024, sherry butt #7, 654 btl.) Nose: more clasically sherried again. Think caramelized hazelnuts and walnuts, toffee, baking spice and milk chocolate. Then fruit cake and exotic, slightly smoky wood. We've come closer to cask #8 again.Mouth: yes, closely related to cask #8. Toffee and vanilla, mixed with drier hints of fallen leaves, herbal tea, gingerbread and artisan cola. A bit of grainy sweetness appears late.Finish: medium to long, with dark fruits, toffee, baking spice and roasted almond.Solid and pretty classic stuff again. Casks #7 and #8 come closest to malt whisky, and indeed also to old Macallan. Blends that make you believe they're not blends - high quality. On the other hand, they're almost the price of similarly aged single malts. Available from Vintage Bottlers. Score: 87/100"

      "summary": "Merry Christmas! We're celebrating with two Glen Grant single malts distilled in the 1950s. This was a time when sherry casks were mostly transport casks, as well as 'local' casks that contained proper sherry. Most importers created their own blend in the UK, from Oloroso and PX components that arrived separately. Back then sherry could still be sold directly from the barrel in pubs or shops.Since 1793, Avery's of Bristol has built a reputation as one of the UK's most pioneering wine merchants. The reputation of their whisky bottlings is certainly high too. Bristol was the center of sherry wine import in the 18th and 19th century, famous for its Bristol Milk and later Bristol Cream style. Together with Harvey's, Mackenzie, Wisdom & Warter or Duff Gordon, Avery's sold loads of sherry - in 1864 almost 50% of the total wine imports to England were sherry. As a side effect they ended up with plenty of well-seasoned sherry casks.I tried this from a bottle opened by Angus McRaild. Heartfealt thanks!"

      "summary": "Just in time for Christmas, we try this Stocking Filler from Royal Mile Whiskies. A similar concept to the long-standing Christmas Whisky from TWE, I guess.While we're at it, also two of their latest bottlings in the classic series. There is also a Springbank 1994 but we'll have this separately later. Stocking Filler - Blended Malt 11 yo (46%, Royal Mile Whiskies 2024, sherry casks) Nose: caramelized malty notes, toasted brioche, some roasted nuts and butterscotch. Then brown sugar, oranges and raisin pastry, as well as a faint hint of leather. Baking spice, of course, like nutmeg and cinnamon. Leaning towards mocha after a while.Mouth: drying nutty notes and allspice again, mixed with sweeter butterscotch and raisins. Hints of cinnamon liqueur and milk chocolate. Then gingerbread and caramel. Light peppery notes. Some candied fruits and marmalade as well.Finish: medium length, with more gingerbread, latte, butterscotch and praline.A fairly simple whisky but the sherry influence makes it richer. A good Christmas character too. Easy to drink and hard to beat at this price. Exclusive to Royal Mile Whiskies. Glentauchers 16 yo 2008 (46%, Royal Mile Whiskies 2024, sherry butt #900255) Nose: a fairly similar style of sherry, with plenty of caramel notes, brown sugar, raisins, leather and toasted brioche. Then perhaps a little more fruity brightness (berries and marmalade). Just a faint meaty hint and bouillon in the background. Nutmeg too.Mouth: fresher now, with a nicely vivid profile. Raisins but also fresh plums, baked apple, herbal honey and tangerines. Salted caramel, nougat and cocoa, a little pepper and delicate leather.Finish: quite long, half fruity, half spicy. Oranges, honey and ginger.A step up: this has a brighter fruity side and feels more elegant. A vivid sherry bottling that will work perfectly once Christmas is forgotten. Available from Royal Mile. Score: 87/100 Glen Grant 21 yo 2003 (53,3%, Royal Mile Whiskies 2024, sherry hogshead #59894, 181 btl.) Nose: nice elegance, with some varnished oak and nice oily notes. Plums, orange peels and red berry candy underneath. Then also cassis, red apple and cinnamon. Hints of floral honey and demerara sugar.Mouth: stewed fruits like apricots, yellow plums, plenty of berries and oranges. Really nice. Even a hint of muscat grape before it moves to moderate spice, a little cinnamon, pepper and honey. Good sweet and sour balance. Then fruit tea, hints of roasted coffee beans, caramelized notes and more herbal honey towards the finish.Finish: quite long, on brown sugar, caramelized pear, pepper and a faint minty note.Another step up: the elegance and polished oak, combined with juicy fruits, make this a success. We have a winner. Available from Royal Mile Whiskies. Score: 88/100"

      "summary": "Acla da Fans in Switzerland celebrated its 10th anniversary not so long ago. Now we're looking at their latest batch of whisky bottlings: four single malts with a Ski Ladies theme on the labels. Ben Nevis 28 yo 1996 (45,1%, Acla Selection 2024, hogshead #412) Nose: starts really well. Fruity notes aplenty, like pineapple, kiwi and papaya. Pink bananas. Quite creamy, almost showing a white chocolate note. Then a nice mineral / waxy side and subtle minty herbs. Candles and paraffin food wraps. Pretty great.Mouth: sweet and fat. More than enough fruits, like bananas and multi-fruit syrup, as well as sweet white grapes. Hints of passion fruits and Cantaloupe melons too. Honeyed and waxy, with vanilla biscuits. Then some pink grapefruits and mineral, gravelly hints. Light herbs and a wee salty edge towards the end.Finish: long, with bright fruits, chalky notes, lime and wax. Still slightly saline.Very waxy with a rather thick sweetness, which masks some of the brightest fruit notes. Nonetheless highly attractive. These 1996s are rarely disappointing, but this is a particularly good cask. Available from Acla da Fans. Highland Park - Whitlaw 20 yo 2003 (54,4%, Acla Selection 2024, hogshead #749) Nose: typical and balanced, though perhaps a little more peaty than the officials (although it may also be the contrast with the Ben Nevis). Some flints and limestone, lamp oil, a lot of ashes, nicely countered with sweet lemons and limes. Then sourdough, seawater and unripe apple, with chalk and wet fabrics.Mouth: smoky and intense, slightly austere for a moment, wih chalky notes, some grass and sweet lemon. Herbal infusions with a few drops of medicins, black pepper, ash and a good saltiness. Still a green fruity note in the background, finishing on a nice bittersweet touch.Finish: long, salty and herbal, fading on pepper and lemons.Good and typical Highland Park at a fair price. For me it doesn't really stand out among the recent wave of indie releases, but if you're looking for a wintery whisky with moderate peat, check it out. Available from Acla da Fans. Score: 87/100 Secret Highland 11 yo 2012 (53,3%, Acla Selection 2024, refill butt #62491) Nose: a leafy start, opening up over time with some pine needles and a faint resinous / mentholated hint. Then apples and lemon skins, hints of pepper and some maritime aromas like iodine. Fine ashy peat.Mouth: mild peat again, balanced by a sweetness. Hints of lemons, plaster and iodine, as well as hints of hessian. Then some subtle nutty notes before the vegetal, grassy side comes back (never my favourite part). Some rooty notes. Very ashy.Finish: quite long, with pepper, a leafy (slightly bitter) note and a vague sweetness from the sherry.We've had a lot of lightly peated Secret Highlands lately, with lots of different suggestions like Ardmore, Jura, Ben Nevis... When forced to choose, I'd go for Ardmore. Overall this one is not extremely complex but offers good value for money. Available from Acla da Fans. Score: 85/100 Port Charlotte 21 yo 2003 (53,4%, Acla Selection 2024, barrel #664) Nose: oh yes, this very particular kind of farmy notes that I've only found in Port Charlotte, Brora and Connemara so far (maybe Ardbeg too). Horse stables with a hint of manure. Also bonfire smoke and sooty notes, as well as pipe tobacco. A glorious combination really. Then some salty kippers and hay, with subtle TCP and smoked herbs. Coastal notes like seawater and seaweed as well.Mouth: very smoky and sooty, really earthy but less farmy now. Roasted coffee beans, creosote, anchovies in salt, tobacco and drops of herbal potions. Nicely tangy, with a citrusy edge. Then back to herbal honey, with a bit of leather, mint syrup and tarry peat.Finish: long, on menthol, tar, brine, lemon and earthy smoke.That's two fantastic whiskies in this series! Really excellent Port Charlotte, exactly how I like them. I find this very reasonably priced as well, perhaps it is the duty free advantage? Highly recommended. Available from Acla da Fans. Score: 92/100"

      "summary": "If you have followed the progress of this show since the beginning, you can see the evolution of what we talk about. In the beginning it was about brands and Master Distillers, then when we started Pursuit Spirits we were introduced into the world of brokers and the middle layer of people who own barrels without brands. That information has made its way to you and now you know more about the market. But that brokered market is heavily guarded. It's a series of handshakes, phone calls, and emails with excel spreadsheets with prices to see what's available. However, Rob Arnold with Barrel Hub is trying to make access easier for everyone. Rob isn't new to this game. He spent his undergraduate in Texas and is the person responsible for the pecan yeast strain used by TX Whiskey to this day. We talk about his background and how that led to the idea of creating a portal where industry folks can buy and sell barrels on the wholesale market.

I think we can all agree that $50 seems to an entrypoint into the mid-tier these days. In this episode, Fred, Ryan and myself, we talk about what we believe to be premium with how the market and economic conditions can effect the prices of your bottles.

We talk about the history of the distillery and their intention on reviving the brand.

      "summary": "As a listener of Bourbon Pursuit, you already know more than the average bourbon consumer that walks the aisles. We get into tons of different discussions that surround the whiskey industry and you've heard us talk about barrels that aren't owned by distilleries but sit on the books of brokers or middle-men. With the explosion of bourbon over the past few years, the cost to acquire those barrels from brokers has sky rocketed, and whenever there is an opportunity to make money, more people get into the game. Today, there are millions of barrels aging in warehouses that don't belong to brands but are done as investments for anybody willing to take the risk. It's really no different than the stock market and for that reason we have Jeremy Kasler and Sara Havens from Cask X join the show. We talk about the business model and how anyone with the some spare money can put their dollars into barrels of whiskey as an alternative investment. We go through the legal ramifications and the unrealized benefits of being a CaskX customer. We also talk about the current market where we are seeing a decline in prices and if that means all good things come to an end or if the market is still strong and is a good place to think about future investments. Show Notes: 00:00-Introduction to Bourbon Pursuit and Barrel Investment 07:12-The Role of Whiskey Enthusiasts in Brand Success 12:53-The Evolution of Barrel Brokering and Investment 21:24-Understanding the Risks and Returns of Barrel Investments 30:32-Market Trends and the Future of Bourbon 40:15-Investor Profiles and Distillery Partnerships Support this podcast on Patreon Learn more about your ad choices.

      "summary": "One thing I love about what we do in this show is that we continue to explore new and interesting angles of the bourbon world. And one that always gets overlooked is the role of public relations. All major corporations have contracts with PR firms where it's their responsibility to get eyeballs on every new release, get butts in seats at events, and make some kind of commotion about their whiskey. To explore this topic, I've invited Dave Karrakur on the show. He's an industry veteran who has done PR his entire career at places like Sega and Campari but has now ventured off on his own with Raptor Communications. We talk about the stress that PR feels when it comes time to put out a new release, how to get it in front of the right audience and get words in articles like Forbes, and how do you response to a client when something just completely flops.

We talk on the show all the time about how we got to know bourbon at a good time but today we get our reality check. I put a message out on a local facebook group in Louisville asking for anyone who has gotten into bourbon in less than a year to send me a message about coming on the show to give us their perspective because I want to know what goes through the mind of today's new bourbon drinker. Brian Sekelsky and Justin Kingery are two new bourbon enthusiasts and we dive into the factors that have influenced their buying habits. We touch on the variety of bourbons available today, including finishes, and the their openness to trying new things instead of chasing what's popular. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about Woodford Double Oak and Blanton's are mentioned as gateway bourbons Cocktails played a role in their bourbon journey, with the Old Fashioned being a favorite. Finding rare bottles and sharing their bourbon experiences with others brings excitement and enjoyment. Personal taste and experimentation are key in the bourbon journey. Intrigue, emotion, and consistency are key factors in the speaker's bourbon collection. We value the experience and emotional connection with bourbon. Social media, YouTube channels, and Facebook groups play a role in shaping the intrigue. We're skeptical about opening expensive bottles and considers price when making purchasing decisions. Label recognition and bottle design influence the speaker's purchasing decisions. The variety of bourbons available today, including finishes, offers new and interesting experiences. We touch on the importance of truth in advertising in the bourbon industry. Support this podcast on Patreon Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices"

      "summary": "In the past two years if you've found yourself scrolling on TikTok or YouTube Shorts, then I'm almost certain you've seen a video by the man that goes by Brewzle. TJ Gamble is the man that goes by Brewzle and he's been a media powerhouse. He's grown his following from just a few thousand subscribers to over a million across all his social channels. He takes a different approach to his videos where it's more about entertainment rather than full blown education. TJ happened to be in Louisville picking some Pursuit United barrels so I invited him to sit down and have a chat about his content and what cheat codes he used to grow a following at such a rapid pace. We discuss how he got into whiskey and the types of content that work well for his fans and how he transitioned from short-form videos to doing more full-length content and trying to start a lawn mower with weller full proof. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about Where did the name Brewzle originate? What piqued your interest in bourbon? Can you explain the idea of the lawn mower with Weller? How did you decide to approach and build your content? Have you seen more success with a certain type of video? Do people feel like your hunting videos are staged? Is your audience looking for hidden gems or stuff from the big 6? What is your cheat code to amassing your audience? What's the long term strategy to growing further? Do you feel Kentucky bourbon has become boring? Is there a certain price point that people find attractive in your content?

      "summary": "One of those indulges that we find ourself in with this bourbon hobby is acquiring a few dusty bottles. And if you've never had a dusty bourbon before, then this episode will wet your appetite for one. There's so many aspects of it but can you imagine building a business off of a non-renewable resource like dusty bourbon? That's what we wanted to know so Brad Bonds and Shannon C Smith of Revival Vintage Spirits join the show. We talk about various aspects of the dusty bourbon market and collecting vintage spirits for sale such as strategies for acquiring dusty bottles, managing inventory and cash flow, vetting buyers, and dealing with potential fakes. We also touch on some legal things but also figuring out what brands stand out in the dusty market. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about whiskey going bad with only a small amount remaining. What led you down the dusty bourbon rabbit hole? Were you trying to buy and acquire dusty bourbon when you were at Cork 'n bottle? What was your strategy on acquiring dusty bottles? Are you scared about your inventory coming to an end? How do you manage your cash flow? How do you vet buyers and look for fakes? Why don't you like to resell Van Winkle? What has changed with the Kentucky Vintage law? What is defined as a vintage spirit? Are Beam decanters are good gateway for those getting started? How do you choose what to open for the open tasting bar? What percentage of your revenue is tastings vs full bottle sales? How do you guide someone in buying a bottle if they have a budget? What products today do you think will be great vintages tomorrow?

      "summary": "A few months ago I came across an article on Vinepair that explained even though we are in the midst of a bourbon boom in American with everything feeling a modern day gold rush to collect every new bottle that comes out, it's the complete opposite in europe. Europeans aren't buying the bourbon boom. But why? To help dive into this, I figured we may as well go straight to the source and invite some europeans on the show. Henrik Brandt and Linus Jonsson are from Denmark and Sweden and give us an insight into what the bourbon scene looks like in their part of the world. We discuss the major issues with limited access, minimal marketing, stigma when compared to high age statement scotches, and how importing inflate prices. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about abolishing the three tier system. How did you find bourbon even though you aren't from America? What was the attraction to bourbon? How hard has it been to spread the word of bourbon? Is access the major issue why bourbon isn't proliferating? Is there a stigma that exists about american whiskey? Is the price too high when compared to scotch and how have the tariffs impacted it? Are we ever going to have a culture shift? Would having a celebrity backing help at all? Why is blending more accepted? How is bourbon marketed and how can you get the bottles sold off the shelf?

      "summary": "Bourbon has a rich history but if you're drinking bourbon right now, you're not doing it because you just found out that a new category like single barrel was created. There are many moments that have now defined modern bourbon culture that have exponentially grown the category in the past 20 years. In this episode, Ryan, Fred, and myself come with a list of moments that we dive into and give our thoughts on what this meant. Some things we hit on are the high-end releases of Willett and the Antique Collection that spur super enthusiasts, how Maker's made national headlines from a proof change, and how social media has changed the landscape forever. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about the future of Bardstown Bourbon Company. What did Four Roses do to help build bourbon? What started the hyper whiskey geek attitude? What special releases changed the landscape of bourbon? How did Brown Forman take Woodford and Old Forester and resurrect the brands? Did the proof debacle from Maker's make a big moment? When did the bourbon media or message boards start making an impact? How did secondary markets on facebook boost the category? Do we feel something like Mad Men was a pivotal moment? Pappygate took national headlines How was Marianne being named the first woman master distillery play a role? What lawsuits defined it?

      "summary": "Starting a whiskey company is no easy task. And making youself stand out from everyone else, it's even harder. There are a handful of companies that supply most of the bourbon we see on the shelves and many of us fall into the trap of buying based off the packaging. However, with this show, we're able to go and find brands who are finding new fans based off their whiskey. Broken Barrel is one of those companies that is forging a new path and finishing their whiskey in such a unique way by rebuilding barrels that we needed to have them on the show. Today we get to talk to Seth Banheim who is the Founder and their Global Brand Manager, Nick Roady about how to stand out in a crowded market. As a brand we have to find new ways to be different and find a way to capture the mindshare of consumers on a whole new level. We also talk about brand education hurdles and how far can you go until you've completely lost a customer. There's a lot to unpack here, especially for those budding whiskey brands who are looking to make a name for themselves. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about eliminating toasted barrels for finishing. What were you doing with a vodka brand and how did it get into whiskey? Where did you see the opportunity to find new types of staves? Do you hate making money? Why was is so important to have a differentiator compared to what has been done already? How does the conversation change when talking to retailers and distributors on being different? What did you learn from Ol Smokey and what they did different? How far can you go before you lose a consumer with brand education? Is there something to a model like yours that can capture consumers of all levels? At what point does differentiation go too far?

      "summary": "If you're a liquor store owner, there are 3 words you hate to hear, \"Got any Blanton's?\". For today's modern whiskey consumer, we know about the iconic bottle shape, the collectible letters, and there's a few different expressions. However, Blanton's played a critical role in the history of bourbon and there are a lot of super rare expressions you will never get a chance to see in your lifetime. To tell this history, Dominic Guglielmi who's the author of Warehouse H comes on the show. He has the one of the most renowned collections of Blanton's on the earth and he even refers to himself as the Ultimate Tater. Beyond just collecting the most coveted bottles around, he has taken the knowledge he learned and the complete history of the brand and put it into a fascinating book that will make you respect it's past and what it has done for the current bourbon landscape. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about palletized warehouses. What's your coming of age tale with Blanton's? What was your first rare Blanton's bottle? What's the most limited bottle ever released? Why was Blanton's created as a product? Who owns the brand? Where did the bottle come from? What releases go into different markets? Is the demand as strong internationally vs domestically? Does the price remain at SRP internationally? What are the secondary prices on the most rare bottles of Blanton's? What do you think of today's typical Blanton's releases? Where are the best Blanton's ending up across the world? What is new Blanton's culture like?

      "summary": "Every year there is a distillery that catches the headlines because they have sold for hundred of millions of dollars. Sounds like a dream for many but to make that dream become a reality, you'll have to know how to value your distillery. For that reason I've invited Kris Bohm on the show. He's the founder of Distillery Now Consulting where he helps folks buy, sell, and install distillery equipment, but he's also found himself in the midst of multiple merger and acquisition conversations. He joins the show to talk about how to value a distillery in the case someone like Diageo or a private equity firm comes knocking. We talk about case sale volumes, the value of aging whiskey in barrels, equipment, brand recognition, and where the trajectory growth curve comes into play. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about the rise of AI and being a writer. What made you want to get into distilling as a teenager? What's the difference in distilling alcohol vs ethanol? Why would a client choose pot vs column? How do you gauge consumer demand and look at sales for calculating value? What does the pool of buyers look like? What is the threshold of a case volume to start the discussion? What's the value in the brand vs the equipment and production? Beyond physical assets, what other factors play into a valuation? How are barrels valued? What's the process for selling a business? Any value in having current distribution? What are roadblocks that often kill deals? Does it matter if case volume happens in the market or at the tasting room? If you can't afford Vendome, where do your point people?

      "summary": "I remember the first time I saw a bottle of WM Tarr. I didn't know much about it except that is was from a company in Lexington and there was well-known football coach supporting the brand. Fast forward a few months and that bottle disappeared from the shelves and was replaced with a new brand called RD1 and it specialized in finished bourbon whiskeys. To help share more of this story, we've invited Barry Brinegar on the show. Barry is a Co-Founder and National Brand Ambassador and gives us the scoop on how their business plan that was only going to focus on gift shop sales got completely disrupted by covid and they had to look at new ways of doing business. We talk about their mission as a company and how they are taking a modern approach to whiskey to find new customers and how a that football coach I talked about landed them a premier placement on ESPN's college football gameday coverage. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about Maker's Mark and the proof change. How did you get started in the whiskey industry? How did you get connected with Mark Stoops? Why release WM Tarr? How did you adapt when covid shut down your business plan? What is the goal of how you are trying to be different? Did your cutover happen overnight and was the plan to switch over already in place? Why go with a modern brand vs traditional? How did you land on your core four products? How involved is Mark Stoops with the brand? Why have so much transparency when it comes to the wood finishing process? Why did you use amburana?

      "summary": "The barrel is where the magic happens and it takes years for your whiskey to achieve it's optimal flavor. Most of us are familiar with the standard american white oak barrel with a char 4. Yet, there are hundreds, if not, thousands of combinations that go into creating a barrel from the wood species, stave seasoning, char, toasting and how it ages based on location in a geography or a floor in a warehouse. There's one guy that does all this research and that's Andrew Wiehebrink from Independent Stave. This is his third time on the show and this time he brings different aging experiments for us to taste through. We taste the same whiskey from different levels of a warehouse and even the same american single malt aged in texas and scotland. We also dive into the state of the barrel shortage, our shared distain of amburana, the shift to char 1, and what new innovations are coming from the barrel and oak alternative market. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about will today's bottles be a new dusty. Talk about what stave seasoning does for the whiskey Why does Kentucky have more extraction than Texas? What does elevation from levels on a warehouse do to the aging process? How often do you revisit experiments? Does the mashbill make a difference to your experiments? Would American Single Malt make more sense to use new vs used barrels? What did the location differences for American Single Malt experiments make? Has the barrel shortage been resolved? Do you research the human element and what consumers are looking for in taste? What do you think of Amburana and exotic wood species? How are you smoking barrels? Why is Char 1 creating a darker whiskey and are there diminishing returns? Does pot vs column still play a role? Where are oak alternatives heading? How do you design a barrel correctly for double oaking? Support this podcast on Patreon Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices"

But on a past whiskey quickie we reviewed Whiskey JYPSI and that one changed our mind. It wasn't until we started diving into it that we discovered Ari Sussman. He's a whiskey maker for many brands like Whiskey JYPSI, Three Chord, and Mammoth Distilling, but his history with spirits will fascinate you. He's truly a student of the art where he spent years overseas bartending, discovered vintage cocktail books, and was an integral part of the first ever university distilling program at Michigan State. We talk to Ari about his past and then dive into the Whiskey JYPSI brand and how Eric Church and himself are trying to change the face of celebrity booze. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about finding better bourbon in the Netherlands. How did you get to this point in your career? What old school cocktails and liqueurs fascinated you? Were you trying to use the University of Michigan distilling program to innovate new things? Can you talk about blending 50ml bottles? What brands did you help build? Why would a company want to ghost blend? How did you get hooked up with Whiskey JYPSI? Why is this celebrity brand different than others? How have you added in Canadian whiskey and light whiskey into a blend? What do you feel is more innovative in world whiskey that's not happening in American whiskey?

A few years ago, there was a flourishing secondary market, droves of new people getting into the hobby, more options on the shelf, and massive expansions from all the big player. We've talked about this being a side-effect of the COVID boom but we also saw american whiskey get into more gimmicks and inflated prices. But we all still need the category to grow, so what's it going to take to reinvigorate more people to get into bourbon?

I had my own where I had really was focused on networking in tech early on but then after I did my first presentation to a room of 500 people, I discovered I really liked it and found a new role in technical marketing. Our guest has a similar story where he wanted to get into distilling, made a successful gin brand then tried to build a whiskey brand, but realized how hard it was and thought, how can I get more people to try our products? And that's how Whiskey Riot was born. Bobby Finan is the Founder and Organizer of Whiskey Riot Festivals across the country and we get into his past of getting into the distilling business and how he took on personal debt to hold his position at his first company and launch Whiskey Riot simultaneously. Now Whiskey Riot is expanding to more cities so if you're looking for a new event to attend, put this one on your list. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about distilleries creating music halls. Before there was a festival, you had your own brand and forged your way into spirits early on. When you wanted to start a distillery did you have a business plan? What was it about your Tommy Rotter gin that really took off? Why didn't your whiskey business ever take off? Did you think you could make people come to you instead of going out to stores? How were you funding Whiskey Riot? What was your return on investment for a typical event? How do you evaluate a city for a new festival?

And when you have kids, maybe that's the reason you start drinking bourbon. Both of these are reasons our guest today decided to call his brand Fathertime Bourbon. Jim Gaffigan needs no introduction because we've all laughed at his jokes throughout the years. Family life is a facet of his standup, and food obviously, but Jim loves to say the things we're all thinking and it's what has made him so successful in his comedic career. Jim Gaffigan joins the show to talk about how he made the switch from beer to bourbon and what drew him in to becoming a bourbon connoisseur or as he likes to call it, a professional alcoholic. From there we dive into his new brand of Fathertime Bourbon and what it meant to incorporate generations of his family and his comedic focus into the story and design. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about proofing whiskey and adding water at home. Can you recall a good college story with Stu Pollard? What made you want to go down the path of being a professional alcoholic? Did you find any correlation between picking barrels and your comedic routines? Did you have the natural progression from mixing to neat? Did you try and buy the rarest stuff right away or look for everyday items? How is bourbon perceived in your circles? Were there anything obvious or strange about bourbon that you discovered? Are you finding yourself traveling to whiskey bars now? How involved were you with the bottle design? What tips do you have for signing bottles and not letting your hands get tired? How did you script the social media launch for the brand? What easter eggs did you hide in the label?

      "summary": "We've had the very cool opportunity to have lots of famous names on this show, and today we get to hear the story of another brand that has been in bourbon for a very long time. In fact, in this episode you get a chance to hear from someone who's family once owned the Old Grandad label. Turner Wathen has a deep family lineage rooted in bourbon, and that originally piqued my interest because I used to own a bottle of Wathen's bourbon. Turner dives deep into his family history and how when he wanted to get into the whiskey business, he couldn't even use his family name. Turner shares his wild decision in 2014 by analyzing the whiskey market and feeling there is too much saturation so he dove into rum. But not just any rum, but he set himself on a mission to become the upmost recognizable independent bottler of amazing, high age stated rum, that is now Rolling Fork Spirits Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about NDPs and bottled in bond. Can you give a background into how you found out your name was famous in bourbon? At what point did you decide to revive the family legacy? Are you still balancing your day job with all this? When did you decide that bourbon was crowded and looked at other spirits? Why is sorghum a bad grain to use? How important is it to find rum with no additives and why is that important? Was Fortuitous Union a mistake or the on purpose? Why was there a legal battle for Fortuitous Union? How much of an educational hurdle did you have to overcome? When did you switch from the Fortuitous Union brand back to a rum focus? Any reason why you haven't worked with any American rum producers? What is going on with all the rum taxes? Are we looking at the rare days of rum that would be equivalent to Van Winkle or early Jeffersons? Support this podcast on Patreon Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices"

      "summary": "This is a question that has plagued me for quite some time and it was inspired by my wife. Ryan and I continuously evaluate brands as we compare what works and what doesn't when it comes to consumers. We get caught in this trap of continually pivoting as we see other brands catch fire because of a bottle design or some element. So my wife asked me, Kenny, are you are whiskey company or a marketing company? It caught me off guard and I really had to think about the broader landscape so I wanted to make an episode where we talk about what it takes to be a whiskey company versus a marketing company. There's probably a lot of brands out there that think of themselves as a whiskey company but in reality they are a marketing company. Here's the thing, there's no wrong answer. Marketing plays a crucial role in whiskey and it could be the marketing that's in your face through point of sale, it could be bottle shapes, or even the lack of marketing to keep the mystique alive. I thoroughly enjoyed this conversation and it probably requires us to hit this topic again in the future if you send us your feedback. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about Maker's Mark and their role in bourbon resurgence. Where do you spend your first initial investment? Does the liquid even matter? Does having special distillation, heirloom grains, or anything else really matter? Can a big distiller be considered a marketing company? When a big distiller creates the same label with different colors and proofs, is that about the whiskey? How do you transition from being a marketing company to a whiskey company? Does it matter if you're getting it from one source like everyone else? Do you need to cater to the neophytes or the mass consumer market? If Fred Minnick starts a brand would you put your money in marketing or the whiskey? Can you be a whiskey company if you are using MGP? Is a lack of marketing considered marketing?

Matt Kusek is a certified whiskey enthusiasts as a write for Malt Review but he's also the host of the Swoosh Life podcast that focuses on sneaker heads. He joins the show to give us an insight into how the shoe game and bourbon have so many similarities that, in Matt's words, sneakers are 20 years ahead of bourbon. We dive into the types of collectors, brands, sales, allocation, and so much more. If sneakers are really 20 years ahead of bourbon, who knows what the next few years has in store for us. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about Buffalo Trace expansion. What's the similarity between Jordan's and bourbon releases? Are there raffles, lotteries, or hunts for sneakers? Who is the distributor and how do they own the retail store? If Nike is number one, who would they be compared to and who's the next biggest?

What is the Heaven Hill or Weller of sneakers? Are there people that only collect one type of shoe? Bourbon hits all walks of life or does the sneaker enthusiasts hit all walks of life? Are there sneakers that don't need marketing? Do you look differently at people who are rookies and buy stuff just because they want every color? Are there any value brands that hold up over time? Are there some LTOs that flop? Are replicas or fakes a big problem? Has the market gone down because everything became a limited edition?

      "summary": "You hear us talk about dusty bourbon on the show too often. We keep beating that dead horse because it's a chance to drink history and have a completely different whiskey than what's in the bottle today. Vintage spirits are on the rise and have gone from an underground enthusiast crowd into the mainstream. Aaron Goldfarb is a distinguished author and he joins the show to talk about his new book titled Dusty Booze. This books has a storyline with finding a dusty goldmine but goes into the story of decanters, minis, and the hunt for rare bottles. It's now available on Amazon and lots of different outlets. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about bourbon with malted barely with the highest secondary grain. What made you want to write a book on vintage whiskey? What were some of those iconic decanters that were made? What was the story you saw form out of the glut era? Did you ever talk to store owners and ask why they would sit on inventory for this long? Why did decanters become so popular or unpopular? What makes a dusty spirit different from today's current releases? Did anyone come up with a better term other than dusty funk?

The market has shifted and there are images of sourced brands that have prices slashed on shelves along with others having their facilities up for sale. This makes us wonder what is in store for the remainder of the year. We talk about what makes NDPs special and how every big distillery was also a NDP at one point as well. There's also a message coming directly from Barrell Bourbon about their current listings. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about hot sauce and bourbon.

      "summary": "Understanding how the bourbon geek thinks has been something that has dumbfounded us for years. We talk about it all the time on roundtables and other episodes where we try to guess why consumers purchase in certain ways. And for the longest time, you all have asked why don't we get someone on the show that can talk about the psychology of a bourbon drinker. Well, ask and you shall receive. In this very special episode, Jim White, the Founder and President of Reality Check consulting who has a background in bourbon advertising and psychology joins the show to talk about how people think and how brands can develop a story. This episode will dive into the psychology of scarcity, pricing, limited editions, repeat purchases, and so much more. During different segments you're going to come away realizing a reason why you chase and hunt bottles as well. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about enforcement of bottled in bond. Can you give a background about Reality Check Consulting? What research methods do you use to get consumer feedback? What things in our psychology trigger us to look at certain brands? How does a brand like Weller go from zero to hero in such a short time? Why should brands create limited edition offerings from a psychology perspective? Is there another type of consumer that just isn't worried about status? How does a brand focused on volume market differently? Why would someone purchase the same bottle over and over again? Do other categories have fans that want their own hobby to fail? Is brand loyalty dead? How do you attract a customer to look beyond what's safe? Does FOMO play a big role? Support this podcast on Patreon Learn more about your ad choices.

      "summary": "Before there were Instagram and TikTok influencers, YouTubers, and even podcasters, there were writers. I'm not talking about bloggers. But esteemed authors and journalists who dug into a story and took it to magazines and other trade publications. The times have changed, our attention spans have gotten much shorter, and now running a story is much different. To help gives more insight into whiskey journalism we've invited Maggie Kimberl back on the show. She's the Content Editor of American Whiskey Magazine and writes some of the most intriguing stories in bourbon today. We all evaluate how access to distilleries have gotten harder through PR firms and how there may be a dilution of valuable content and talent because the barrier to entry is much lower through social media. It's not all doom and gloom though. We are now in a time when there is more to talk about than ever in bourbon. There is going to be no shortage of new stories with the boom of so many new distilleries and entrants into the market. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about the lobbying groups for whiskey and bourbon. How small was the community in whiskey journalism? Has the access to the distillers and the people changed over the years? How many more events are there now? At what point in time did you start seeing a shift happen from deep articles vs click bait? If writing isn't a means to have a successful career did judging whiskey awards feel like a next step? What are the types of stories in magazines that people really latch on to and engage? Do stories on bourbon tourism do well? Do you see a problem with short-form content and those content creators? Do big brands even need bourbon media any longer?

      "summary": "The platform of this podcast was to help connect listeners to the brands they see on the store shelves. As time has gone on, sometimes we discover there really isn't much substance to a brand. But today's guest is the very opposite. I found myself enthralled with our guests history in the culinary world and what he's doing to make his whiskey be one that many can appreciate from the liquid to the blending. Sean Josephs is the Co-Founder & Master Blender behind Pinhook. You know all those bottles with race horses on the label and different colored wax. Sean talks about getting his start in restaurants, grinding it out, and eventually working at some of the world's premier establishments and becoming such a decorated wine sommelier that he would be considered famous by those standards. Consider me a bit star struck by the time this episode is over. Then he finds a new passion in bourbon and opens up one of the first ever whiskey bars in Brooklyn and eventually left to start Pinkhook bourbon. Sean's passion comes through and we learn the secret decoder ring to knowing more about all his Pinhook bottles and what's in store for the future. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about adding water to high proof whiskey. What's your background and how did you get into bourbon? As a somm, do you remember the most epic wine? Was starting a whiskey bar in 2008 in Brooklyn a bold move? Were barrel selections becoming popular for restaurants in 2016? What made you want to stop doing bars and restaurants and start the whiskey brand? Can you explain the packaging and colors and how they work? What makes your whiskey special and what are you doing there? How long do you think you'll have enough whiskey to keep your projects going?

      "summary": "The barrel is a magical component to the creation of bourbon and nearly 95% of all bourbon goes into white oak. But what's the problem with this? Bourbon can only be used in a charred barrel once. After that, it needs to find a new home. Now that may sound wasteful but the bourbon market is only a very small contributor to the current white oak problem. To help us better understand about forestry and the white oak supply I've invited Daana Baxley from the Nature Conservancy in Kentucky to join the show. She gives some great insight into the current state of white oak trees and what is currently being done to protect our forests. I've never known what it takes to manage forests and this episode will give you an insight into grading and how invasive species of trees continue to decline the white oak population. But more so, Daana gives us some insight if we will ever experience a white oak shortage in the future and what we can do to help protect it. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about running out of old bourbon. What took you on a path to nature preservation? How are you able to achieve your mission without using scare tactics? Why is Appalachia so important? What does \"protection\" mean in the sense of a nature conservancy? What is the current status of the white oak species? What is the proper way to manage these forests? What does high grading mean? How has ash or maple impacted the population? How many years into the future are we looking at when we will see a big white oak problem? Is the bourbon industry a problem or is there another industry to blame? Do bourbon drinkers even care if there is sustainability practices happening? Do other industries join in conversation practices like the white oak initiative?

Sometimes it's RTDs, sometimes it's tequlia, and one spirit that seems to make it's way into more conversations is American Single Malt whiskey. However, I told myself that if we're going to talk about American Single Malt whiskey then we need a person that can really go indepth. What better person than Steve Hawley who is the President of the American Single Malt Whiskey Commission. Steve joins the show to talk about his background starting Westland Distillery and then formed the commission. We talk about the growth of the category, production methods, exports, and it's current journey to being recognized by the rest of the world. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about the effect of climate change. How did you get into the whiskey business? If barley grows so well then why isn't there a history of it? What is the importance of trying to make American Single Malt an approved category? How did you become the president of the commission? How have case sales grown from 2010 till today? Is the SMWC analogous to DISCUS or KDA? What is the proposed definition of American Single Malt and what's the current status of it? What rules were valid versus ones that seemed really weird? Why do people prefer pot still for single malt production? When a heritage brand creates a single malt like Jim Beam and Heaven Hill, does this hurt or help? Are American Single Malt producers starting to look at exports instead of domestic education?

      "summary": "Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, we finally see the re-emergence of Ed Bley. Ed has been a previous guest on the podcast that was from way back in 2018. So if you just started listening to Bourbon Pursuit, then you probably have no idea of the impact Ed had on the bourbon world during that time. Ed went into hiding and went on a mission to bring some new whiskey to the world and he's now back presenting his new line called Old Stubborn. We talk about his background in blending and the journey he took from working at Cork N Bottle, picking barrels, and being a big influence in the larger bourbon community to losing hope on building a distillery and then quickly pivoting to find whiskey that wasn't available on the open market. This is one of the most anticipated interviews for many of you long-time listeners so enjoy this episode with Ed Bley. Show Notes: Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about sustainability and new oak barrels. What is your background and what were you doing on the retail side? How often do you reject barrels during a barrel selection? Can you give some background on Old Baldy? Why would you want to leave a comfortable position to do your own thing? Why would you want to start a distillery versus sourcing barrels? How did you search for whiskey to use? Why did you call the whiskey Old Stubborn? Is there a reason why you put the word \"old\" on your bottles? Can you talk about how you ended up on the bottle? What went into this first release? How did the conversations start to acquire your whiskey stocks? Is this high price a sustainable business model? What does your product strategy look like?

But as we start diving more into our bourbon journey we start realizing that age is just a number. I've had some really great bourbons at 4 years old and some really great at 14. With all that being said, at what point should you proudly display that age statement on the bottle? In this roundtable, we dive into this topic and look at the history of age statements and when we started paying attention to them. There's also brands that have a lot of success without an age statement like Maker's Mark and most of the Buffalo Trace portfolio. And now that the modern bourbon consumer has been accustom to seeing age statements, would you pass on a bottle just because it said 4 years old on it?
